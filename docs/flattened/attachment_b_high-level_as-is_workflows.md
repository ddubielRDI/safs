in both PDF and Excel formats in a OSPI directory

The finalized budget files are automatically saved in PDF and Excel formats within
designated OSPI directories.

13.  When all districts are complete, the EDS

“Combine/Print” function is run. This creates files
for posting to the OSPI Website and SQL files for
exporting to Access.

Once all district budgets are finalized, OSPI runs the Combine/Print process to produce
website-ready files and SQL exports for database use.

14.

Create PDF Files for Website

PDF versions of the finalized budget files are generated for publication.

15.

Analyze Budget

OSPI SAFS Staff (Jackie McDonald) reviews prior-year data, projected revenues, and allocation patterns to validate
the integrity of baseline assumptions before producing baseline numbers.

Create Baseline
Number Files

OSPI SAFS Staff (Jackie McDonald) generates baseline number files based on the approved formulas and business
rules. These files establish the starting point for district budget projections.

Import Baseline XML
Files

OSPI IT Support imports the generated baseline number XML files into the F-203 system, ensuring that all values
and code references load accurately.

Perform Annual
Updates

Notify Updates
Completed

OSPI IT Staff adds, updates, or deletes item codes, formulas, and business rules in preparation for the new fiscal
year. This includes rolling forward data to the next year and, if needed, rolling back prior-year data for corrections.

OSPI IT Staff notifies SAFS Staff and ESDs that the annual setup and configuration updates are complete and ready
for testing.

Test Annual System
Updates

OSPI SAFS Staff (Jackie McDonald) conducts system testing to verify all annual updates (codes, formulas, rules)
function correctly before approval. If issues are identified, they are resolved before proceeding.

Approve Annual
Updates

Once testing is successful, OSPI SAFS Staff (Jackie McDonald) formally approves the annual updates and confirms
readiness to generate the baseline data.

Release system to
school districts

OSPI SAFS Staff (Jackie McDonald) releases the system to school districts through the F-203 portal, enabling
districts to begin their budget projections.

Create F-203
Estimates

School districts use the released baseline data to create their F-203 budget estimates for the upcoming fiscal year,
adjusting for local assumptions and projections.

10

Input F-203 Data

School districts enter their budget projections (revenues, expenditures, enrollment assumptions) into the F-203
application.

Run Edits (District
Level)

Ready for Review
(District)

Submit to ESD for
Review

School districts run system edits to validate their data for consistency, completeness, and compliance with state
rules. Any edit errors must be corrected before submission.

After all edits pass successfully, the school district marks the F-203 file as ready for review and submits it to the
ESD.

School districts formally submit their F-203 budget projection data to the ESD for review and verification.

Review Budget
Projection Data (ESD)

ESD staff review the submitted F-203 data for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with state funding rules.
They may return the file to the district if corrections are required.

Ready for Review
(ESD)

Once the ESD review is complete and data are validated, the ESD marks the file as ready for OSPI review.

Submit to OSPI for
Review

The ESD submits the reviewed and approved F-203 data to OSPI SAFS Staff (Jackie McDonald) for statewide
validation and processing.

Review F-203 Data
(OSPI)

OSPI SAFS Staff (Jackie McDonald) reviews all submitted F-203 files to confirm that the data aligns with approved
funding formulas, rules, and statewide projections.

resubmit. If no issues exist, the process continues.

Submit Corrected Data
to OSPI (if applicable)

If changes are required, the school district or ESD resubmits corrected data to OSPI for final validation.

Generate F-203
Extract (XLS)

OSPI SAFS Staff (Jackie McDonald) generates the final F-203 extract in Excel format (.xls) summarizing statewide
budget projections and allocations.

Save F-203 Extract to
Shared Drive

OSPI SAFS Staff (Jackie McDonald) saves the final approved F-203 extract to the shared drive for archival and
reporting purposes.
