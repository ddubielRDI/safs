| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 001APP | The apportionment system must be able to directly ingest and process revenue forecasting and budget preparation data without requiring staff to manually download, regroup, and re-upload files. By automating the regrouping of item codes and ensuring alignment with apportionment categories, the system will eliminate a repetitive, time-consuming task that creates risk of human error. This will increase efficiency during monthly processing cycles and reduce the dependency on staff intervention for routine data preparation. | Manual Handling of revenue forecasting and budget preparation Data | Currently, the apportionment process requires staff to download F-203 data, manually regroup item codes to match apportionment categories, and then re-upload the data into the system. This step is both repetitive and error-prone, adding unnecessary complexity to monthly processing. SME confirmed that despite earlier hopes of streamlining, this remains “absolutely still happening” and continues to be one of the most significant inefficiencies in the workflow. | Data Collection | Apportionment | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002APP | The new solution must be designed to process apportionment calculations significantly faster, ideally within one hour, and without locking staff out of the system during processing. This requires scalable system architecture capable of handling large datasets efficiently while supporting concurrent operations. Reducing calculation time and enabling parallel activity will improve productivity, allow staff to verify results sooner, and ensure timely payments to districts. | Long Processing Times for Calculations | One of the most critical issues raised is system performance. Running apportionment calculations can take between four to six hours, during which time staff are locked out of making other updates. This bottleneck delays downstream processes such as report verification and compliance adjustments. SME noted that this not only slows monthly processing but also creates stress during peak deadlines when timely funding distributions are critical. | Data Calculation | Apportionment | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003APP | The apportionment system should allow staff to run calculations for specific subsets of districts (e.g., only charter schools or selected districts) in addition to statewide runs. It should also support running multiple calculations in parallel to accommodate testing scenarios or partial recalculations. This flexibility will save staff considerable time and reduce the burden of processing one district at a time, ensuring that recalculations can be targeted and efficient. | Annual Carryover Recovery Outside the System | The system restricts staff to processing calculations either for all school districts or one at a time. It does not allow selective runs, such as calculating only for charter schools or a subset of districts. This limitation adds considerable manual work, especially when staff need to test or reprocess smaller groups. The lack of flexibility contributes to inefficiency and prolongs processing cycles. | Data Calculation | Apportionment | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004APP | The system must automatically map revenue codes to budget codes, eliminating the current reliance on Excel spreadsheets. This functionality should be configurable to adjust for legislative or budgetary changes without requiring manual intervention each month. Automating the crosswalk will reduce errors, standardize reporting, and provide greater confidence in the data submitted to the Budget Office and other stakeholders. | Manual Compilation of Reports in Adobe | After calculations, staff must manually convert revenue codes into budget codes using Excel spreadsheets before reports can be shared with the Budget Office. This manual crosswalk is time-consuming and prone to human error. It represents a critical control point that should be automated within the system to improve accuracy and reduce redundant handling of financial data. | Data Calculation | Apportionment | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005APP | All compliance-related calculations that are currently performed using standalone Excel tools should be integrated into the apportionment system. This includes Learning Assistance Program (LAP) allocations, High Poverty calculations, Physical/Social/Emotional Support (PSES) compliance, and K-3 class size compliance. Incorporating these tools will provide a single source of truth for funding calculations, reduce risk from undocumented or unsupported spreadsheets, and allow for real-time updates and error checking within the system itself. | ADA Compliance for Reports | A significant number of compliance-related calculations are performed outside of the apportionment system using Excel-based tools. SME described how programs like the Learning Assistance Program (LAP), High Poverty, Physical/Social/Emotional Support (PSES), and Kindergarten–3rd Grade (K-3) class size compliance require manual updates and re-uploads into the apportionment system. These tools were inherited and not fully documented, creating risks when they break or require troubleshooting. Integrating these functions into the system would minimize errors and improve sustainability. | Data Calculation | Apportionment | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006APP | The system must include built-in functionality to process carryover recovery annually, using F-196 data directly rather than relying on external spreadsheets. By automating this once-a-year process, the system will ensure consistency, reduce the risk of manual miscalculation, and provide clearer audit trails. This will also allow districts to view and verify recovery calculations in real time, improving transparency and accountability. | NaN | At year-end, carryover recovery must be processed using external spreadsheets. Data from F-196 reports, provided by finance staff, is compared against district expenditures, and unspent funds are clawed back. SME explained that this once-a-year process is entirely manual, requiring reconciliation outside the apportionment system before uploading adjustments. This introduces inefficiencies and potential audit risks. | Data Calculation | Apportionment | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007APP | The system should be able to compile individual district reports into a single consolidated package automatically, without requiring Adobe Acrobat scripting or manual manipulation. This includes generating both district-level and statewide rollups in standardized formats, with the ability to schedule or batch reports as needed. By automating report compilation and distribution, staff time will be saved, errors minimized, and reports delivered faster to fiscal teams and the public website. | NaN | The apportionment system produces multiple individual reports for districts, but it lacks the ability to generate a consolidated package. SME must download the reports, then use Adobe Acrobat and JavaScript scripts to compile them into a single deliverable. This manual step is both technical and cumbersome, and SME admitted she does not fully understand the code in the script, making it fragile if errors arise. Automating report compilation within the system would significantly reduce reliance on Adobe scripting and minimize risk. The current format of the PDF reports does not meet ADA accessibility standards. | Data Reporting | Apportionment | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 008APP | While reports have not been processed through ADA compliance tools in recent years, the system should still be capable of generating reports in an ADA-compliant format if required by state or federal guidelines. This may include automated tagging, accessible formatting, and compatibility with assistive technologies. Clarifying the requirement with OSPI leadership will determine whether ADA compliance remains mandatory, but the system should be designed with accessibility in mind to ensure long-term compliance flexibility. | NaN | The 2018 process indicated that all reports had to undergo ADA compliance remediation before posting. SME stated she has never performed ADA remediation and suspects that OSPI has an exception to bypass this requirement. This means the original pain point may no longer apply, but it remains an area requiring clarification. | Data Reporting | Apportionment | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001BUD | The system must migrate to a modern, database-driven architecture interactive front end. This should allow users (districts, ESDs, auditors, unions) to report data dynamically without reliance on Access or manual file handling. Historical data must be standardized and version-tracked so that cross-year comparisons remain valid even when formulas or item codes change. This self-service capability would streamline audit support, reduce IT workload, and ensure timely delivery of accurate financial information to auditors. | Manual and Outdated Systems (Access, Excel, Legacy Design) | Much of the financial reporting (F195/F197) relies on outdated tools such as Access databases, Excel spreadsheets, and early-1990s style processes. For example, Access files must be manually created and uploaded to OSPI’s site. Item dictionaries and formulas change year to year, creating inconsistencies in historical data. Districts and unions rely on these outputs but may not be aware of underlying calculation changes. This creates unnecessary bottlenecks and dependencies, especially during audit season when requests are frequent and time sensitive. The process adds delays, consumes IT bandwidth, and increases the risk of errors being introduced during hand-offs. | Data Reporting | Budgeting | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002BUD | The system must allow authorized OSPI staff to adjust F-197 balances and item codes directly through a controlled user interface, with full audit logging to track changes. This would eliminate reliance on IT staff for routine balance corrections, reduce turnaround times for resolving errors, and ensure that financial data used by districts, ESDs, and OSPI is always accurate and up to date. | Inability to Correct Values Without IT Support (F197 & F200) | SME frequently encounters issues where balances (e.g., beginning fund balances in F197) do not roll forward correctly. Currently, he cannot change many item codes himself and must request IT to manually fix errors. SME explained that balances frequently fail to roll forward correctly from the prior year, and many of the item codes are locked for editing. This means that even simple corrections—sometimes for small dollar amounts—require OSPI staff to call IT support. Such dependency results in days of delays, creates unnecessary workload for IT, and prevents timely resolution of errors. This limitation undermines OSPI’s ability to reconcile balances quickly and to keep financial reporting accurate. | Data Calculation | Budgeting | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003BUD | The system must generate automated notifications (emails or dashboard alerts) to OSPI reviewers when districts or ESDs submit extensions. Notifications should also cascade across stakeholders (district → ESD → OSPI) to ensure smooth workflows. | Lack of Automated Notifications (F200 Extensions) | When school districts submit budget extensions (F200), there is no automated alert to SME. He must manually log in and check for pending submissions. This is inefficient and risks delays in review and approval. | Data Collection | Budgeting | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004BUD | The system must automatically detect and apply the most recent F-200 submission for each district and fund when updating appropriations. Historical submissions should remain archived for audit purposes, but only the latest submission should feed into current year budget calculations and F-196 actuals. This ensures consistency, accuracy, and transparency in budget reporting, even when multiple extensions are submitted throughout the year. | Limited Transparency into F-200 History and Difficulty Managing Multiple F-200 (Budget Extension) Submissions | Districts frequently submit multiple F-200 budget extensions within the same fiscal year—for example, one in November due to levy revenues and another in March due to grants. Historically, the system struggled to identify which extension was the “most current” for reporting purposes. This created confusion in applying appropriation values and resulted in reporting errors. Although partial fixes were made, SME emphasized that ensuring the system always selects the latest valid submission is critical for budget accuracy. | Data Calculation | Budgeting | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005BUD | The system should include built-in mechanisms to monitor and enforce timely updates from ESDs. Features should include automated reminders for overdue submissions, dashboards displaying real-time submission status across districts, and escalation alerts when delays exceed thresholds. By providing transparency and accountability, OSPI would have the ability to track compliance and mitigate the risks caused by late updates. | Dependence on ESD Timeliness (F197 Treasurer’s Report) | F-197 reporting is dependent on Educational Service Districts (ESDs) to input reconciled balances based on Treasurer’s Reports. However, ESDs often lag in completing these updates, sometimes by four to six months. As a result, OSPI lacks access to current financial data for projections and reconciliations. This delay introduces risk in financial oversight and reduces the accuracy of forecasts. Compounding the problem, OSPI has no authority or tools within the system to enforce timeliness or to monitor lagging submissions. \n\nThere is not an RCW to enforce timely updates of the F-197 by the ESDs.\nOSPI has the role of development and access to the F-197, but this system was created as a tool for the district’s to monitor cash balances and payments. | Data Collection | Budgeting | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006BUD | The system must have a clearly defined, transparent, and consistent framework for edits and business rules. Each edit should be documented, with criteria specifying whether it references current-year or prior-year data, and error messages should be written in plain language that users can understand. Additionally, edits should be configurable so OSPI staff can update rules without IT intervention. This would reduce manual checks, streamline reviews, and improve user confidence in the accuracy of system validations. | Business Rules and Edits | Edits in the budgeting systems (F-195, F-200) are sometimes unclear, inconsistent, or misaligned with actual business rules. SME explained that edits are often used interchangeably with “business rules,” and in some cases, edits force unnecessary manual checks against prior-year values. This inconsistency increases workload for staff, creates confusion for districts, and reduces confidence in the system’s error-checking functionality. | Data Collection | Budgeting | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007BUD | The system must replace Access-based reporting with a modern, secure, and scalable solution. A centralized data mart or SQL-based repository should store F-195 data, with self-service reporting capabilities provided through a user-friendly visualization tool such as Tableau. This would allow districts, unions, and OSPI to filter, query, and analyze data without technical barriers, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and long-term sustainability of reporting. | Reliance on Outdated Access Files for F-195 Reporting | F-195 budget reporting outputs are currently generated as Microsoft Access database files. SME noted that this is a legacy approach, prone to corruption, and requires manual intervention to create and distribute. Access is no longer a supported platform for enterprise reporting, and its limitations prevent flexible, modern analysis. School districts and unions depend on these files for extracting program-level and object-level data, but the process is cumbersome and risks inconsistencies year to year, especially when item codes or formulas change. \n\nA CSV file format would be better in the future. It would allow for the front end user to have access to all the data on back-end | All | Budgeting | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001INT | The apportionment system must store data in a centralized relational database that retains both current and historical data in a consistent schema. Lookup tables for schools, account codes, and activity codes must be integrated, ensuring a single source of truth. This structure should support direct query, automated reporting, and the ability to generate dashboards without relying on manual Excel manipulations. | Data stored in Excel instead of a centralized database | Currently, critical apportionment and enrollment data is not housed in a centralized database but rather in disparate Excel files and extracts. SME explained that apportionment outputs only exist as Excel extracts stored on the S-Drive, which are inconsistent year over year. This leads to fragile processes, as the manual handling of files risks data corruption and makes it harder to build reliable dashboards. | Data Calculation | Data Integration Reporting | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002INT | The system should automate data ingestion and transformation, eliminating the need for manual formatting. Enrollment data should flow directly from the source system into the apportionment database, reducing dependency on staff and ensuring consistent, verified inputs. | Dependence on manual processes and staff (SME for enrollment data) | Data pipelines rely heavily on manual intervention. For enrollment data, SME must request specific pivoted reports from SME, who produces them manually in Excel. This dependency creates bottlenecks, delays, and version control issues where multiple files can circulate, creating doubt in data accuracy. | Data Collection | Data Integration Reporting | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003INT | The apportionment system must include fully maintained lookup/reference tables for schools, accounts, and activity codes within the same database environment. This ensures that all reporting processes can directly query human-readable names alongside financial and enrollment data | Missing or fragmented reference data (codes, schools, activities) | When creating reports, SME must manually join data from multiple servers to resolve codes into meaningful labels (e.g., school names, activity names). This adds complexity, slows down report generation, and introduces opportunities for mismatched joins. | Data Collection \nData Calculation | Data Integration Reporting | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004INT | The system must enable SQL-based stored procedures for core reporting needs, reducing reliance on R scripts and manual processing. This supports automation, improves reliability, and makes reporting auditable and repeatable. | Reports not structured as reusable stored procedures | Currently, SME uses R scripts to join, clean, and prepare data for Tableau visualizations. While functional, this approach lacks scalability and reusability. Routine reports could be encapsulated in SQL stored procedures for consistency, automation, and reduced maintenance. \n\nCustomer prefers fully automation of the scripts over the current system only if an internal SAFS staff member can have access to the code for maintenance and troubleshooting | Data Reporting | Data Integration Reporting | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005INT | The system should enforce schema stability and provide access to 10–20 years of historical data. Historical datasets must be retained in a standardized format, enabling longitudinal studies, forecasting, and legislative reporting without manual archival. | Data inconsistency across years and lack of historical depth | Apportionment extracts change column layouts from year to year, breaking queries and requiring SME to re-engineer Power Query steps. Additionally, prior-year retention is limited, with only recent data available (post-2019). This prevents long-term trend analysis and weakens forecasting capability. | Data Calculation | Data Integration Reporting | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006INT | The system should support forecasting and trend analytics by retaining deep historical data and providing data models optimized for predictive reporting. Standardized schemas and consistent historical records will enable more robust analysis to support decision-makers. | Limited ability for forecasting and proactive analytics | Currently, SME can only report on what happened last year. Without structured, historical, and standardized data, forecasting trends such as levy collection or district financial health is difficult and time-intensive. This limits the ability to provide proactive insights for policy and decision-making. | Data Calculation\nData Reporting | Data Integration Reporting | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001ENR | The new system must calculate totals directly from source enrollment data in real time. Any discrepancies should be automatically flagged. The reporting engine should ensure consistency between displayed totals and exported data, eliminating manual reconciliation. | Reports not showing correct totals | During reporting, totals displayed on the screen sometimes don’t reflect actual student-level data. This occurs because the current system relies on cached calculations that may time out, resulting in zero or incomplete totals. Districts and OSPI staff then waste time reconciling mismatched numbers, and confidence in the system’s accuracy is eroded. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002ENR | The system must preserve original data when revisions are made. Revision forms must be pre-populated with prior values, and validations must block submission of “zero” revisions unless explicitly intended. | Revisions erase previously reported numbers | When districts create a revision and hit “Save,” sometimes all numbers in the file are zeroed out due to system slowness. This not only forces resubmission but also risks OSPI unknowingly processing blank files, which could lead to incorrect funding allocations. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003ENR | The system must maintain clear separation between original files and revisions. Only the selected revision should be deleted, and a confirmation step plus audit log must protect original submissions. | Deleting a revised file deletes the original | Staff noted that deleting a faulty revision sometimes also deletes the original baseline file. This creates data integrity risks and could erase official enrollment counts needed for auditing and apportionment. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004ENR | The system must enforce strict validations at data entry: headcount values must be integers, and FTE values must be decimals with exactly two places. | Only accept numbers with correct format | Districts sometimes enter invalid formats (e.g., decimals in headcount, or FTE without proper decimal places). These formatting errors disrupt apportionment calculations and require staff intervention. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005ENR | The system must allow OSPI staff to “lock” submissions for a defined period each month. During this lock window, districts/ESDs cannot submit revisions until OSPI reopens the system. | Ability to prohibit revisions during processing | Currently, while OSPI staff are running monthly enrollment and apportionment calculations, districts can still submit changes. This disrupts processing and creates data mismatches. SME specifically requested a “lock button” to prevent this. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006ENR | The system must display edits in a clear, user-friendly way, highlighting critical errors. Submissions should be blocked until critical edits are resolved, and comments must be meaningful. School-level edit visibility should also be considered. | Edit process not effective | Districts are required to run edits before submission, but often they don’t review them carefully. Some districts provide placeholder comments without addressing the discrepancies. This reduces the quality of enrollment data and pushes the burden to OSPI staff. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007ENR | The system should give OSPI the ability to enforce program/school-level validation rules – limiting what type of enrollment can be reported at a given school type (e.g., Open Doors in R-schools, Skill Centers only at designated schools). This could include limiting the grades that can be reported to specific schools (e.g., Kindergarten reported at a high school). | Missing school-level validations | Currently, districts can submit logically inconsistent enrollments, such as non-Skill Center FTE at a skill center. These errors go undetected until OSPI staff review reports manually, delaying correction. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 008ENR | The new system must integrate ALE and P223 collections. Submissions should be cross-validated automatically, with discrepancies flagged immediately for districts before final submission. | Manual reconciliation between P223 and ALE | OSPI staff must manually compare P223 and ALE data collections to ensure counts match. When mismatches occur, staff must email districts and request corrections. This is repetitive, slow, and prone to oversight. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 009ENR | The new system must support electronic batch uploads for ALE data, allowing districts to upload files rather than manually entering records. | Lack of electronic uploads for ALE | If ALE remains its own collection, districts are forced to manually key data into the system one district at a time. This is tedious and error-prone, especially for large districts with multiple ALE programs. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0010ENR | The new system must digitize these collections, providing secure online forms for submission. Data must flow directly into the central system for reporting and apportionment calculations. \n | Paper-based collections still in use (E672, E525, P213, P223YC, UW enrollment) | Institutional Education (E672), Home/Hospital (E525), Non-High (P213), Washington Youth Academy (P223YC) and UW enrollment reports are still submitted via paper or email, then manually entered into spreadsheets. This adds workload and increases the chance of transcription errors. | Data Collection\nData Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0011ENR | The system must automate apportionment file preparation. It should calculate FTEs and generate apportionment-ready outputs in the required formats, eliminating reliance on manual Excel work. | Manual apportionment file preparation | Currently, SME and others manually extract data, run pivot tables in Excel, and build text files for apportionment. This process is inefficient, repetitive, and highly error-prone. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0012ENR | The system must automatically track submission status and generate reminders for outstanding districts. A dashboard should display submission compliance in real time. | Manual identification of non-submitting districts | OSPI staff must manually determine which districts have not submitted their files and then send individual reminder emails. This is time-consuming and risks missing districts. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0013ENR | The new system should maintain version control of submissions. Original monthly counts should be archived and accessible for audit purposes, even if later revisions occur. | Inconsistent data when revisions override confirmed counts | Earlier, OSPI staff noted that finalized monthly counts could be overwritten by later revisions, making it impossible to retrieve the original version. SME clarified this is less critical now, as final counts are accepted as authoritative, but some staff still see value in audit history. | Data Collection\nData Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0014ENR | The system must generate ADA-compliant reports by default. Interactive web reports or accessible PDFs should be provided, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards. | Non-ADA compliant reports | Reports posted on the web are static PDFs and not ADA compliant. This limits accessibility for users with disabilities and does not meet state and federal compliance standards. | Data Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001EXP | The apportionment system must include a secure, cost-effective digital certification workflow that complies with OSPI and SAO approval standards. It should allow for flexible integration with digital signature platforms (e.g., Adobe, DocuSign) and ensure an auditable approval trail. This requirement reduces costs, eliminates paper, and ensures OSPI staff can validate certifications in real time without depending on costly external platforms. | Manual & fragmented certification/sign-off process | Previously, districts and ESDs mailed signed certification pages, which was replaced by DocuSign. While effective, SME noted DocuSign is expensive and may be excessive for the level of security needed. He suggested Adobe’s certificate-based signing could achieve the same outcome at lower cost. | All | Financial Expenditures Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002EXP | The updated system should continue supporting electronic retention and provide secure storage with search and retrieval capabilities, ensuring records are audit-ready without paper. | ADA Compliance for Reports | OSPI staff previously printed expenditure pages for review and record retention. SME confirmed this is no longer required since documents are stored electronically. | Data Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003EXP | The system must automate federal reporting crosswalks by embedding mapping logic between the state chart of accounts and federal formats (F-33, NPEFS, SFFLS). It should allow OSPI staff to configure and maintain mapping rules, generate outputs in federally required formats, and update crosswalks as federal definitions evolve. This reduces manual rework, ensures accuracy, and accelerates compliance reporting. | Complex crosswalk for federal reporting (F-33, NPEFS, SFFLS) | OSPI’s chart of accounts differs from federal formats. SME must manually build crosswalks by pulling SQL data into Tableau, exporting to Excel, then re-exporting into custom Excel workbooks. This is highly inefficient and error-prone. | Data Calculation\nData Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004EXP | The system must empower OSPI staff with role-based administrative controls to manage rollover tasks, edit configurations, and update report templates without external support. This ensures greater agility, reduces costs, and allows staff to align system updates with workload cycles. Consultants should only be required for major upgrades or structural changes, not routine adjustments. | Reliance on Consultants for Rollover/System Changes | SME expressed frustration at relying on external consultants for even minor changes like adjusting formulas, edits, or report text. This dependence creates delays, raises costs, and limits flexibility. Internal staff lack the permissions or tools to perform basic updates. | All | Financial Expenditures Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005EXP | The system must include embedded documentation, training guides, and knowledge transfer materials. It should also store business rules (e.g., edits, approval conditions) in a transparent, staff-accessible format. This reduces onboarding pain, preserves institutional knowledge, and ensures continuity when staff transitions occur. | Lack of Documentation & Training | SME inherited the system with minimal knowledge transfer and had to reverse-engineer processes, creating inefficiency and risk. He highlighted that institutional knowledge was lost when prior staff left. | All | Financial Expenditures Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006EXP | The system must include automated notification workflows tied to status changes (system open, submission received, edits required, approval completed). Notifications should be configurable by user role and include both email and in-system alerts. This reduces manual communication overhead, improves timeliness, and ensures districts/ESDs have clear visibility into status changes. | Manual Notifications (System Open, Submission Status) | Notifications such as system opening, submission readiness, and approvals are currently sent via manual emails. This increases administrative overhead and creates potential for delays or missed deadlines. | Data Collection | Financial Expenditures Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007EXP | The system must support direct online submission of F-185 reports by ESDs with validation and edits built in. It should allow aggregation within the system, generate standard reports, and integrate ESD data into federal reporting calculations. This eliminates manual Excel handling, ensures consistency, and improves data quality before OSPI staff receive files. | F-185 Reporting by ESDs (Excel Driven, No Edits) | ESDs currently complete F-185 in Excel templates with no built-in edits. SME aggregates their submissions manually via Tableau and Excel joins. The process is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks quality control. | Data Collection | Financial Expenditures Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001TRB | The system must be enhanced to include a robust data warehouse that stores historical apportionment and financial data. This repository should support multi-year analysis, allow users to query past records without reloading files, and ensure easy traceability for audits and policy validation. | Lack of Historical Data Storage | The apportionment process currently operates more like a calculator, performing real-time calculations but without storing historical data. As a result, SME and her team must manually extract and compile years of Excel files to perform any trend analysis, forecasting, or validation. This is time-consuming, creates risks of data inconsistencies, and prevents efficient responses to legislative or district-level inquiries. | Data Calculation\nData Reporting | Financial Policy Tribal Research | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002TRB | The system must enforce policy-driven retention schedules and automate the secure archiving or deletion of records in accordance with RIM rules. This will reduce database load, improve performance, and ensure compliance with state and federal audit standards. | Absence of Automated Record Retention / Destruction | The current system does not have automated record retention or destruction processes in place. Over time, this creates large, unmanageable datasets and raises compliance concerns since OSPI is required to adhere to strict records management (RIM) rules. The lack of automation leaves staff with the burden of manually managing records, which increases the risk of errors and missed compliance deadlines. | Data Calculation | Financial Policy Tribal Research | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003TRB | The new system should provide direct database access, user-defined fields, and no-code calculation capabilities to minimize reliance on manual Excel work. It should also include built-in data normalization features to streamline reporting and reduce the risk of discrepancies. | Reliance on Manual Excel Processing & Error-Prone Workflows | Much of the work today depends on exporting Excel files, cleaning them, and creating temporary databases. This reliance on manual processes increases errors, limits scalability, and consumes staff time that could otherwise be spent on higher-value analysis. It also leads to duplicate efforts when different teams rebuild similar datasets for their own reporting. | Data Calculation | Financial Policy Tribal Research | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004TRB | The system should provide a dedicated sandbox environment that allows for safe testing of new formulas, legislative updates, or code changes. This environment must mirror production data, ensuring accurate modeling without disrupting live operations. | No Sandbox Environment for Legislative Updates & Testing | When new legislation or policy changes impact apportionment formulas, SME and her team cannot test or simulate these updates within the system. Instead, they are forced to build and maintain large Excel-based models (“Mega” and “Mighty”), which are cumbersome, fragile, and prone to inaccuracies. This makes it difficult to provide timely, accurate feedback to policymakers. | Data Calculation | Financial Policy Tribal Research | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005TRB | The system must have native ADA-compliant reporting capabilities, automatically generating outputs that meet accessibility standards. This will reduce remediation effort, improve turnaround time for publishing reports, and ensure equitable access to information. | Non-ADA Compliant Reports | Reports generated from the current system are not ADA-compliant. SME often spends days manually remediating reports to meet accessibility standards before publishing them. This adds unnecessary delays, limits transparency, and introduces risks of non-compliance with accessibility laws. | Data Reporting | Financial Policy Tribal Research | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006TRB | The system should provide a unified data model and shared access framework to ensure that all teams use the same authoritative source. Standardized reporting and integration across systems will reduce duplication, eliminate inconsistencies, and increase trust in outputs. | Data Silos & Inconsistent Use of S-275 Data | Different OSPI teams pull S-275 and related data in different ways, often resulting in inconsistent outputs and interpretations. This lack of standardization undermines confidence in the data and forces additional reconciliation work across departments. | All | Financial Policy Tribal Research | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001PRS | The new system must integrate with the confidentiality program database and automatically identify records flagged for redaction. Built-in logic should prevent unauthorized exposure by applying redactions before reports are published. Additionally, the system should maintain an audit trail of redactions to meet compliance requirements and reduce the reliance on individual staff expertise. | Manual Redaction of Confidential Records | The current S-275 process still relies on manual redaction of personally identifiable information for individuals in the Address Confidentiality Program. SME explained that certain records cannot be made public, requiring a manual step to identify and remove these from Access reports before publishing. This adds risk of oversight, introduces delays, and consumes staff resources, especially since confidential records must be verified against certification system data.

| 002PRS | The future system should generate ADA-compliant outputs by default. Reports should follow Section 508 and WCAG standards without manual intervention, ensuring accessibility for screen readers and other assistive technologies. By automating accessibility formatting, OSPI staff can focus on analysis rather than rework, and the agency can ensure consistent compliance with legal accessibility standards. | Manual ADA Compliance Updates | All public-facing reports must meet ADA accessibility requirements, but currently the formatting is applied manually by OSPI staff after generating Access/Excel outputs. SME confirmed that this process is not tied to a fixed monthly cycle but arises whenever reports are prepared, requiring repetitive adjustments such as table reformatting and accessible PDF conversion. This increases turnaround time and introduces inconsistency in accessibility compliance. | Data Reporting | Personnel Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003PRS | The system must centralize all calculations within a secure and auditable environment. This includes compliance ratios, apportionment metrics, and K-12 penalties. Automated workflows should pull enrollment data directly, apply standardized formulas, and generate results that can be traced and validated. Eliminating Excel/Access dependencies will ensure continuity if key staff leave and allow broader staff access to calculations. | Manual Calculations for Apportionment and Ratios | SME explained that while the S-275 system collects data, almost all calculations for staff-per-student ratios, compliance checks (K-3, K-12 penalties), and PSES staffing are performed outside the system in Excel or Access. Additionally, enrollment supervisor provides P223 files externally, which SME then uses for apportionment calculations. This separation from the core system introduces errors, requires specialized staff knowledge, and creates dependencies on spreadsheets that are not scalable or auditable. | Data Calculation | Personnel Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004PRS | The new system should provide a secure, intuitive interface where both districts and ESDs can submit, review, and correct data directly. The UI should allow file uploads with built-in validation, but also permit authorized edits without forcing resubmission. Features like guided forms, upload status dashboards, and real-time feedback would reduce submission errors and make the process more efficient for non-technical users. | Unfriendly User Interface for Data Submissions | School districts currently submit S-275 data using structured text files formatted to a rigid layout. SME confirmed that while OSPI and ESDs can correct data directly in the system, districts cannot — they must resubmit files. The system lacks a user-friendly web interface, requiring technical expertise at the district level and limiting transparency. SME also noted that historical processes where ESDs reviewed district files are no longer consistently followed, leaving districts largely unsupported. | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005PRS | The future system must replace Access with a modern database or warehouse solution. Role-based security should allow multiple OSPI staff to run calculations, extract reports, and access data without bottlenecks. Centralizing the data in a supported environment will also enable integration with downstream systems and improve business continuity by reducing reliance on a single expert. | Dependence on Access Database for Staff Calculations | Staffing data is still processed and analyzed in Microsoft Access. SME described a workflow where district submissions are exported from EDS into Access, where queries and macros are run to prepare compliance and apportionment data. This approach restricts access to one SME and limits data availability to a small group. Access is also an aging technology with limited IT support, creating risk for long-term sustainability. | Data Calculation\nData Reporting | Personnel Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006PRS | The system should provide automated notifications via email, dashboard alerts, or SMS integration. For example, when the system opens for the year, all districts should receive a system-generated notice. If a district misses a submission cutoff, automated reminders should trigger. These alerts should be configurable to reduce manual follow-up by OSPI staff. | Manual Notifications to Districts/ESDs | Notifications to school districts and ESDs — such as opening of the reporting year or reminders for late submissions — are still handled manually. SME sends emails or calls districts when deadlines approach. This consumes staff time, creates delays, and risks districts missing deadlines if communication is inconsistent. This was noted in 2018 and persists today | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007PRS | The system must include automated publishing options that generate simplified datasets and reports with predefined field subsets. Configurable export formats (CSV, Excel, PDF) should be supported, with automated scheduling. This ensures consistency and reduces staff effort while maintaining control over sensitive data. \n | Manual Production of Simplified Data Versions | SME confirmed that staff still manually create simplified versions of S-275 data in Access, Excel, and PDFs for public or stakeholder consumption. This requires reformatting and extraction of selected fields. The process is repetitive and error-prone, with little standardization across outputs. | Data Reporting | Personnel Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 008PRS | The system should support configurable edit rules with different enforcement levels. Certain errors should block submission until resolved, while others may remain as warnings. This would improve data quality while still allowing flexibility. A dashboard for tracking unresolved edits should also be provided, so districts know exactly what requires attention. | Data Validation and Edit Limitations | SME described three levels of edits: (1) format-level checks (blocking), (2) warnings, and (3) errors. While format errors stop processing, warnings and errors do not — meaning flawed data can pass through the system. In practice, many edits serve only as advisory, and OSPI must rely on districts to self-correct. This reduces data quality and creates inconsistencies across districts. | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 009PRS | The system should include automated reconciliation workflows for mismatched records. Exception dashboards should flag conflicts (e.g., mismatched SSN, name changes) and route them to the appropriate OSPI team for timely resolution. Data synchronization between S-275 and eCertification should be near real time to minimize errors. \n | eCertification System Integration Issues | SME explained that S-275 and the eCertification system share common fields like Social Security numbers. In the past, mismatches caused frequent reconciliation issues, though improvements have reduced the volume to only a handful per year. Still, when mismatches occur, OSPI certification staff must manually resolve them, sometimes taking weeks. This creates frustration for districts and delays in record acceptance. | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0010PRS | The new system must provide robust ad hoc reporting tools with a user-friendly interface. Users should be able to filter, aggregate, and export staffing data without requiring database skills. Role-based permissions should control access to sensitive data fields, while still enabling flexible reporting for authorized users. This capability would empower staff across OSPI to self-serve and reduce bottlenecks on specialized personnel. | Lack of Ad Hoc Reporting Capability | SME described frequent ad hoc data requests that cannot be fulfilled directly in EDS. Instead, he manually extracts data from Access or Excel, creating custom datasets on demand. This is time-intensive and error-prone, and it prevents broader OSPI staff from accessing staffing data without SME intervention. | Data Reporting | Personnel Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |

The system should replace manual Excel-based aggregation processes with automated, coded data integration from F-196 and other sources. Users must be able to combine and separate data for reporting at the district, ESD, and school levels. | Support data aggregation and disaggregation for reporting | OSPI is in the early stages of a process by which we'll be able to identify all EDS data by codes, taking what was an Excel based-system to aggregate Annual Financial Statement data with less manual processing. As such, OSPI wants an easy Apportionment System function that aggregates data from the districts to create the report in the format that we want.

The integration shall follow OneWA’s published interface and security specifications, ensuring seamless, automated payment initiation and reconciliation between the Apportionment and Workday systems | Provide connectivity between WorkDay and Apportionment | The system shall support direct integration with One Washington (One WA), Washington's cloud-based, enterprise-wide system for finance, procurement, budget, HR and payroll processesto exchange invoice and payment data, e.g., to transmit approved invoice data to One WA for payment processing. | Data Reporting | External Integrations | SAFS | Epic | Technical | NaN | NaN |
| 004SAFS | The system shall have the ability to prepare, load, and manage a four-year sandbox containing funds, rules, and budget assumptions used to simulate legislative impacts on the apportionment system. OSPI staff must be able to enter and update (e.g., enrollment, charter counts, pension rates) these models efficiently whenever new legislative budgets are passed. The sandbox shall include an approval process with time-stamped authorization, maintain multiple saved versions of each scenario, and synchronize finalized legislative updates with the SAFS production environment. | Support preparing and loading sandbox with four years of funds and rules | In response to each budget passed by the legislature, OSPI needs to be able to load the new rules and funds into the system for the coming four years.

It shall provide contextual information describing the nature of corrections, the reason for each update, and the effective date of change. The feature shall ensure transparency while maintaining the integrity of the audit trail, distinguishing clearly between pre-audit and post-audit versions. | Display Annual Financial Statement changes to public | When districts find an error they've made or have a finding by an auditor, they send OSPI a paper correction. OSPI reviews and makes manual updates, but these aren't displayed to the public until the following year's budget, and there's a little note that says that it's been updated. As an improvement, the system must display changes to the public earlier, with more information about the changes. | Data Collection | Annual Financial Statement (F-196) | SAFS | Epic | Budgets Data | NaN | NaN |
| 006SAFS | The new Apportionment System must adopt a secure, modern login process, such as Entra ID or federated authentication.

External users will be restricted from modifying data while OSPI is performing calculations. Lock periods will typically last up to three days each month. | Lock Enrollment data after a certain point | Program Supervisor of Enrollment & Institutions wants a way to lock the Enrollment Reporting (P-223) Enrollment, SAFS ALE, and K-3 Class Size to prevent external users from updating data in those systems, during the monthly cycles (of up to three days) while OSPI is processing enrollment, so that calculations aren't affected by new information. | Data Collection | ALE\nK-3 Class Size\nEnrollment Reporting (P-223) | SAFS | Feature | Enrollment | NaN | NaN |
| 008SAFS | The system must standardize item codes across budgeting (F195, F196, Estimate for State Revenues (Estimate for State Revenues (F-203)) and payment (Apportionment) systems. Currently, inconsistent coding leads to confusion and manual corrections. A unified coding structure will minimize errors and reduce time spent reconciling data. Standardization will also support smoother cross-system data integration and reporting. | Coding inconsistencies between systems must be resolved | The budgeting and payment system presently has numerous item codes that differ between the systems but have the same meaning. Resolving these differences will reduce errors and time spent creating files. | Data Collection\nData Calculation | All | SAFS | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 009SAFS | The system must clearly distinguish audit adjustments within reports by showing when and how each change occurred. Currently, adjustments overwrite prior values without context, making audit trails unclear. The improved design should log adjustment dates, sources, and rationales. | Audit-driven changes must be made clearer | When audit adjustments are made, they are added into the adjustment column displayed on a report. When adjustments are made to adjust from the prior year both values have to be added together manually. There is no way to see when each adjustment is made; the values are just replaced with new ones. It makes it difficult to see the month in which these occur without the backup saved each month. Normalizing this process will save time and reduce errors. | Data Calculation | All | SAFS | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 010SAFS | All report calculations currently performed through external macros must be integrated into the Apportionment System. Doing so eliminates dependency on outdated 16-bit macro program and manual workarounds. The system should execute these calculations natively to produce district-level PDFs and other outputs. | Calculations must be brought into the system | Numerous reports are still calculated outside of the Apportionment system, using old macros to generate PDF reports for each district. The macro was programed using 16-bit which requires OSPI to use an old computer to run these reports. Normalizing this process will save time and reduce errors. | Data Calculation | All | SAFS | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 011SAFS | Currently, districts are identified in SAFS using the CCDDD (County/District number), which does not distinguish special cases, requiring manual adjustments in Excel. The system shall provide the capability to identify and reclassify exceptions for specialized institutions such as Charter Schools, Tribal Schools, and Juvenile Detention Schools within the apportionment system. It shall automate the process of converting monthly payment and compensation increase data from revenue codes to appropriate AFRS budget codings, using appropriation codes matched to school identifiers. This automation shall replace the current manual Excel-based process and ensure accurate, fund-specific reporting for all school types. | Charter School and Compensation Increase calculation exceptions must be automated | Monthly payment data is converted from revenue codes displayed on reports to AFRS budget coding. And because Charter Schools are paid out of a different fund most of their payments need to be removed from each revenue code and combined into a different budget coding. This is also similar to the compensation increase budget coding. | All | All | SAFS | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 012SAFS | The system must enforce data-entry validation rules for all integer fields. When entering numbers, users may input digits only, and the system should automatically display commas for readability once data entry is complete. Attempts to exceed the permitted digit limit should trigger an error message. This control minimizes data entry errors and ensures consistent numeric formatting throughout the system. | Masks for integer fields | When the focus is on an integer field, the system will refuse anything typed by the user except numbers. When the user tabs from the field, the system will display commas in the appropriate places. So if the field type is 9 integer, then the max field length would be 11 (nine digits plus two commas). If the user happens to type 11 digits and no commas, the system displays an error message. | Data Collection | All | SAFS | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 013SAFS | The system must validate decimal inputs by allowing only digits and one decimal point within the field. Users may not exceed the configured number of decimal places or total digits. If invalid input is detected, the system must display a clear, human-readable error message. This feature maintains data precision and consistency for all numeric fields requiring decimals. | Masks for decimal fields | When the focus is in a decimal number field, the system will ignore anything typed by the user except numbers and the decimal. The system will ignore anything typed after the maximum number of decimal places allowed. So, if the field type is 9.2 decimal, then the max field length would be 14 (nine digits, two commas, one period, two more digits). If the user happens to enter something other than what is allowed, such as 14 digits, the system will display an error message. | Data Collection | All | SAFS | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 014SAFS | The system must display calculated values on data entry or reporting screens but restrict users from editing them. These read-only fields should be visually distinct, such as by using a shaded background. This ensures users can view system-derived values for verification while maintaining data integrity. | Display of calculated fields | A field that contains a value derived from a system calculation is displayed on the appropriate data input or report page but cannot be edited by the user. Such fields are indicated by a physical differentiation, such as the presence of a grey background. | All | All | SAFS | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |

| 018SAFS | The system must standardize date entry, display, and storage formats for accuracy and usability. Dates must be stored as MMDDYYYY and displayed with slashes (MM/DD/YYYY), regardless of input format variations such as MM.DD.YYYY. For month/year-only fields, the system must retain MMYYYY and display it accordingly. This uniformity improves data compatibility and user experience across all modules. | Entry, display, and retention of dates | Wherever a date that includes the day of the month is required (as opposed to a Month/Year), the date must be retained as MMDDYYYY. When displayed, slashes ("/") will be inserted between the Month and Day, and Day and Year.\nUsers may enter the month as MMDDYYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, MM,DD,YYYY or MM.DD.YYYY.\nWherever a date that does not include the day of the month is required, they must be retained as MMYYYY. This value will be displayed either as Month, Year (in one or two fields) or MM/YYYY, as described in the User Interface specification.\nDepending on the User Interface specification, Months may be selected from a dropdown menu or entered as MM.

Each year, between June 1 and September 10, all 295 Washington school districts shall submit their completed Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) forms to their Educational Service District (ESD). The system shall allow the ESD to review the submitted data, run system validations, and update the form’s status either to return it to the district for corrections or forward it to OSPI for approval.\n\nIn cases where the ESD provides business management services for one or more districts, the system shall allow the ESD to log in as the district, complete the Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) on their behalf, and update the status from “In Process at District” to “Ready for ESD Review.” After review, the ESD shall be able to change the status to “Ready for OSPI Review.” The system shall track all status changes, ensure data integrity, and support final review and approval by OSPI. | Estimate for State Revenues (Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) Purpose | Every year, between June 1 and September 10, each of Washington's 295 School Districts must submit a completed Estimate for State Revenues (F-203): Estimate for State Revenues electronic form to their Educational Service District (ESD). The ESD reviews the data entered by their Districts, runs the system edits against the data and, depending on whether they find any errors, changes each form’s status to either return it to the originating District so that it can be corrected, or makes it available to OSPI for review and approval. (In some cases, the ESD provides business management services to one or more Districts and completes the Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) on behalf of those districts. In this event, the ESD is logged in as the district, and once the form is completed, updates the status of the document from ‘In Process at District’ to ‘Ready for ESD Review’. The user then uses his or her ESD login and updates the document’s status to ‘Ready for OSPI Review’.)

Additionally, the system shall allow districts to submit one or more revisions to their Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) estimates for the current year after the budget has been adopted, maintaining a complete history of all revisions for audit and compliance purposes. | Estimate for State Revenues (Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) Data Purpose | OSPI uses Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) data, along with the district’s final adopted budget, to determine state apportionment payments for the months from September to December. (From January to August, apportionment payments are based on actual year-to-date enrollment, staff ratio, and other factors, rather than the estimates provided by Estimate for State Revenues (F-203).) If a district fails to properly complete the Estimate for State Revenues (F-203), their budget may be built around erroneous revenue projection and their apportionment payments may be delayed or miscalculated.

| 138SAFS | The system shall support optional summer enrollment submissions for districts, with built-in business rules to determine apportionment timing. If a summer enrollment report is submitted and accepted by OSPI by August 20, the apportionment shall be scheduled for the November payment cycle. Reports submitted after August 20 shall have apportionment scheduled for January. The system shall automatically apply these business rules, track submission dates, and flag late submissions for funding exclusion from levy and LAP calculations. | Optional summer enrollment reporting | Some districts may choose to report their summer enrollment once in August or sometime before the November 25 deadline. Districts that wait and report their enrollment after the August 20 deadline will not receive their summer apportionment until the following January, and the summer enrollment will not be included in the district's levy calculation or LAP funding. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting (P-223) | SAFS | Business Rule | Levy Data | NaN | NaN |
| 139SAFS | The apportionment system shall implement logical validation edits within the Enrollment Reporting (P-223) module to restrict the types of enrollment that can be reported based on each school’s designated grade range and type. | Create logical enrollment type limitations based on school type in Enrollment Reporting (P-223) | The system must provide edits to limit the kinds of enrollment a school can report.

| 140SAFS | The apportionment system shall support the Personnel Reporting (S-275) process, which provides an annual census of school district staffing based on an October 1 snapshot. The system shall collect and maintain data for all staff providing educational services, including both certificated and classified employees, as well as contracted personnel who serve during the school year. The Personnel Reporting (S-275) module shall distinguish between certificated and non-certificated staff as required by OSPI reporting standards. Unlike enrollment data, which is captured monthly, Personnel Reporting (S-275) staffing data shall be collected annually to provide an accurate count of personnel and support statewide analysis of staffing trends, compliance, and funding considerations. | Personnel Reporting (S-275) System purpose | The Personnel Reporting (S-275) provides an annual census of school district staffing, based on an October 1 snapshot. This data tells OSPI who is providing educational services--all staff, not just certificated, although there are differences between certificated and other staff. Tracks both hired and contracted staff, who provide their services anywhere during the school year. In contrast to the Personnel Reporting (S-275)'s once a year educator count, enrollment is counted once a month because it's more dynamic, and because schools are directly funded based on the student count, not the staffing count. | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting (S-275) | SAFS | Business Rule | Staffing Data | NaN | NaN |
| 141SAFS | The apportionment system shall recognize that staff hired after the October 1 snapshot date are not included in the Personnel Reporting (S-275) staffing report but shall still have their salary and expenditure data captured within the F-196 module. The system shall not allow post–October 1 staffing adjustments to the Personnel Reporting (S-275) dataset, as the snapshot represents a fixed annual record. It shall also support and display expected variances between employee counts in the Personnel Reporting (S-275) and F-196 modules, since districts are funded based on student enrollment rather than staffing levels. | Employees added after Personnel Reporting (S-275)'s October 1 snapshot | If staff are hired after October 1, they are not included on the Personnel Reporting (S-275), but their salaries are captured on the Annual Financial Statement (F-196) regardless. Schools cannot make adjustments to that annual snapshot; they are funded by the students they serve, not the educators that serve them. As such, employee counts in the Annual Financial Statement (F-196) and the Personnel Reporting (S-275) will often not match--and that's OK. | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting (S-275) | SAFS | Business Rule | Staffing Data | NaN | NaN |
| 142SAFS | The apportionment system shall differentiate between the operational school year used by most districts (typically September through June, with optional summer programs) and the Personnel Reporting (S-275) reporting school year, which runs from September 1 through August 31. The system shall ensure that Personnel Reporting (S-275) data aligns with this defined reporting period, regardless of local school calendars, to maintain compliance with OSPI staffing data standards and ensure consistency across all districts. | Differentiation between actual school year and Personnel Reporting (S-275) school year | Most districts run a school year September through June plus, for many, summer programs.

| 144SAFS | The apportionment system shall derive School District and Educational Service District (ESD) data—including CCDDD codes, district and ESD names, and their hierarchical relationships—from enterprise tables shared across all Education Data System (EDS) applications. User permissions and access rights shall also be managed centrally through these shared tables. Updates to this data shall be performed by authorized personnel at the database level, ensuring that any changes made are automatically reflected in the Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) system and all related apportionment modules. The system shall maintain real-time synchronization with the shared enterprise data to ensure consistency, eliminate redundant data entry, and preserve data integrity across all EDS applications. | School district, ESD data, user permissions derived from tables shared with other EDS applications | School District and ESD data (e.g., CCDDD, Name, relationship of districts to ESDs) and user permissions are shared across the enterprise, and are entered and maintained not through an Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) user interface but via the intervention of an authorized individual who will likely make changes from the back end (that is, directly to the table in the SQL database), which will simultaneously update values in the Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) System and all the other apportionment systems | Data Collection | All | SAFS | Constraint | Technical | NaN | NaN |
| 145SAFS | The apportionment system shall automate the reporting process for Community and Technical Colleges (CTC), Open Doors, and Running Start programs. The system shall enable CTCs to report student hours directly to the CEDARS data system, eliminating the need for districts to manually review Enrollment Reporting (P-223) RS reports and re-enter data. Similarly, Open Doors and Running Start program data, which are currently distributed to districts on paper forms for manual entry, shall be transmitted electronically and integrated automatically into the apportionment system | Automate CTC, Open Doors, and Running Start Data Reporting | Program Supervisor of Enrollment & Institutions wants an automated process for Community and Technical Colleges (CTC) system to be able to report student hours directly to Cedars, rather than as now, where the districts review the Enrollment Reporting (P-223) RS and, if they are OK with the numbers, they manually add that information to the Enrollment Reporting (P-223).

## Data Collection
| ID | Requirement Description | Background Title | Requirement Background ["Pain Point"] | Work Section | Legacy SAFS System area of interest | Type | Sub Type | Vendor Readiness | Vendor Readiness Explanation (If Small or Large Customization, Third Party Product, Other, or Cannot Address |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0010ENR | The new system must digitize these collections, providing secure online forms for submission. Data must flow directly into the central system for reporting and apportionment calculations. \n | Paper-based collections still in use (E672, E525, P213, P223YC, UW enrollment) | Institutional Education (E672), Home/Hospital (E525), Non-High (P213), Washington Youth Academy (P223YC) and UW enrollment reports are still submitted via paper or email, then manually entered into spreadsheets. This adds workload and increases the chance of transcription errors. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0012ENR | The system must automatically track submission status and generate reminders for outstanding districts. A dashboard should display submission compliance in real time. | Manual identification of non-submitting districts | OSPI staff must manually determine which districts have not submitted their files and then send individual reminder emails. This is time-consuming and risks missing districts. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0013ENR | The new system should maintain version control of submissions. Original monthly counts should be archived and accessible for audit purposes, even if later revisions occur. | Inconsistent data when revisions override confirmed counts | Earlier, OSPI staff noted that finalized monthly counts could be overwritten by later revisions, making it impossible to retrieve the original version. SME clarified this is less critical now, as final counts are accepted as authoritative, but some staff still see value in audit history. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001APP | The apportionment system must be able to directly ingest and process revenue forecasting and budget preparation data without requiring staff to manually download, regroup, and re-upload files. By automating the regrouping of item codes and ensuring alignment with apportionment categories, the system will eliminate a repetitive, time-consuming task that creates risk of human error. This will increase efficiency during monthly processing cycles and reduce the dependency on staff intervention for routine data preparation. | Manual Handling of revenue forecasting and budget preparation Data | Currently, the apportionment process requires staff to download F-203 data, manually regroup item codes to match apportionment categories, and then re-upload the data into the system. This step is both repetitive and error-prone, adding unnecessary complexity to monthly processing. SME confirmed that despite earlier hopes of streamlining, this remains “absolutely still happening” and continues to be one of the most significant inefficiencies in the workflow. | Data Collection | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001EXP | The apportionment system must include a secure, cost-effective digital certification workflow that complies with OSPI and SAO approval standards. It should allow for flexible integration with digital signature platforms (e.g., Adobe, DocuSign) and ensure an auditable approval trail. This requirement reduces costs, eliminates paper, and ensures OSPI staff can validate certifications in real time without depending on costly external platforms. | Manual & fragmented certification/sign-off process | Previously, districts and ESDs mailed signed certification pages, which was replaced by DocuSign. While effective, SME noted DocuSign is expensive and may be excessive for the level of security needed. He suggested Adobe’s certificate-based signing could achieve the same outcome at lower cost. | Data Collection | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002INT | The system should automate data ingestion and transformation, eliminating the need for manual formatting. Enrollment data should flow directly from the source system into the apportionment database, reducing dependency on staff and ensuring consistent, verified inputs. | Dependence on manual processes and staff (SME for enrollment data) | Data pipelines rely heavily on manual intervention. For enrollment data, SME must request specific pivoted reports from SME, who produces them manually in Excel. This dependency creates bottlenecks, delays, and version control issues where multiple files can circulate, creating doubt in data accuracy. | Data Collection | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002SAFS | The Apportionment System must allow OSPI to aggregate and disaggregate district-level financial data to facilitate comprehensive reporting. The system should replace manual Excel-based aggregation processes with automated, coded data integration from F-196 and other sources. Users must be able to combine and separate data for reporting at the district, ESD, and school levels. | Support data aggregation and disaggregation for reporting | OSPI is in the early stages of a process by which we'll be able to identify all EDS data by codes, taking what was an Excel based-system to aggregate Annual Financial Statement data with less manual processing. As such, OSPI wants an easy Apportionment System function that aggregates data from the districts to create the report in the format that we want. Authorized users could then crosswalk all ESD and District data, aggregate it for our reports, then disaggregate it to the school level for DOE and Census. | Data Collection | All | Epic | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003BUD | The system must generate automated notifications (emails or dashboard alerts) to OSPI reviewers when districts or ESDs submit extensions. Notifications should also cascade across stakeholders (district → ESD → OSPI) to ensure smooth workflows. | Lack of Automated Notifications (F200 Extensions) | When school districts submit budget extensions (F200), there is no automated alert to SME. He must manually log in and check for pending submissions. This is inefficient and risks delays in review and approval. | Data Collection | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003INT | The apportionment system must include fully maintained lookup/reference tables for schools, accounts, and activity codes within the same database environment. This ensures that all reporting processes can directly query human-readable names alongside financial and enrollment data | Missing or fragmented reference data (codes, schools, activities) | When creating reports, SME must manually join data from multiple servers to resolve codes into meaningful labels (e.g., school names, activity names). This adds complexity, slows down report generation, and introduces opportunities for mismatched joins. | Data Collection | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004ENR | The system must enforce strict validations at data entry: headcount values must be integers, and FTE values must be decimals with exactly two places. | Only accept numbers with correct format | Districts sometimes enter invalid formats (e.g., decimals in headcount, or FTE without proper decimal places). These formatting errors disrupt apportionment calculations and require staff intervention. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004EXP | The system must empower OSPI staff with role-based administrative controls to manage rollover tasks, edit configurations, and update report templates without external support. This ensures greater agility, reduces costs, and allows staff to align system updates with workload cycles. Consultants should only be required for major upgrades or structural changes, not routine adjustments. | Reliance on Consultants for Rollover/System Changes | SME expressed frustration at relying on external consultants for even minor changes like adjusting formulas, edits, or report text. This dependence creates delays, raises costs, and limits flexibility. Internal staff lack the permissions or tools to perform basic updates. | Data Collection | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004PRS | The new system should provide a secure, intuitive interface where both districts and ESDs can submit, review, and correct data directly. The UI should allow file uploads with built-in validation, but also permit authorized edits without forcing resubmission. Features like guided forms, upload status dashboards, and real-time feedback would reduce submission errors and make the process more efficient for non-technical users. | Unfriendly User Interface for Data Submissions | School districts currently submit S-275 data using structured text files formatted to a rigid layout. SME confirmed that while OSPI and ESDs can correct data directly in the system, districts cannot — they must resubmit files. The system lacks a user-friendly web interface, requiring technical expertise at the district level and limiting transparency. SME also noted that historical processes where ESDs reviewed district files are no longer consistently followed, leaving districts largely unsupported. | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004SAFS | The system shall have the ability to prepare, load, and manage a four-year sandbox containing funds, rules, and budget assumptions used to simulate legislative impacts on the apportionment system. OSPI staff must be able to enter and update (e.g., enrollment, charter counts, pension rates) these models efficiently whenever new legislative budgets are passed. The sandbox shall include an approval process with time-stamped authorization, maintain multiple saved versions of each scenario, and synchronize finalized legislative updates with the SAFS production environment. | Support preparing and loading sandbox with four years of funds and rules | In response to each budget passed by the legislature, OSPI needs to be able to load the new rules and funds into the system for the coming four years. This is called the sandbox. | Data Collection | Annual Financial Statement (F-196) | Epic | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005BUD | The system should include built-in mechanisms to monitor and enforce timely updates from ESDs. Features should include automated reminders for overdue submissions, dashboards displaying real-time submission status across districts, and escalation alerts when delays exceed thresholds. By providing transparency and accountability, OSPI would have the ability to track compliance and mitigate the risks caused by late updates. | Dependence on ESD Timeliness (F197 Treasurer’s Report) | F-197 reporting is dependent on Educational Service Districts (ESDs) to input reconciled balances based on Treasurer’s Reports. However, ESDs often lag in completing these updates, sometimes by four to six months. As a result, OSPI lacks access to current financial data for projections and reconciliations. This delay introduces risk in financial oversight and reduces the accuracy of forecasts. Compounding the problem, OSPI has no authority or tools within the system to enforce timeliness or to monitor lagging submissions. \n\nThere is not an RCW to enforce timely updates of the F-197 by the ESDs.\nOSPI has the role of development and access to the F-197, but this system was created as a tool for the district’s to monitor cash balances and payments. | Data Collection | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005ENR | The system must allow OSPI staff to “lock” submissions for a defined period each month. During this lock window, districts/ESDs cannot submit revisions until OSPI reopens the system. | Ability to prohibit revisions during processing | Currently, while OSPI staff are running monthly enrollment and apportionment calculations, districts can still submit changes. This disrupts processing and creates data mismatches. SME specifically requested a “lock button” to prevent this. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005EXP | The system must include embedded documentation, training guides, and knowledge transfer materials. It should also store business rules (e.g., edits, approval conditions) in a transparent, staff-accessible format. This reduces onboarding pain, preserves institutional knowledge, and ensures continuity when staff transitions occur. | Lack of Documentation & Training | SME inherited the system with minimal knowledge transfer and had to reverse-engineer processes, creating inefficiency and risk. He highlighted that institutional knowledge was lost when prior staff left. | Data Collection | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005SAFS | The system shall have the ability to display updated post-audit versions of reports such as F-196, Personnel Reporting (S-275), and enrollment data to the public in a timely manner. It shall provide contextual information describing the nature of corrections, the reason for each update, and the effective date of change. The feature shall ensure transparency while maintaining the integrity of the audit trail, distinguishing clearly between pre-audit and post-audit versions. | Display Annual Financial Statement changes to public | When districts find an error they've made or have a finding by an auditor, they send OSPI a paper correction. OSPI reviews and makes manual updates, but these aren't displayed to the public until the following year's budget, and there's a little note that says that it's been updated. As an improvement, the system must display changes to the public earlier, with more information about the changes. | Data Collection | Annual Financial Statement (F-196) | Epic | Budgets Data | NaN | NaN |
| 006BUD | The system must have a clearly defined, transparent, and consistent framework for edits and business rules. Each edit should be documented, with criteria specifying whether it references current-year or prior-year data, and error messages should be written in plain language that users can understand. Additionally, edits should be configurable so OSPI staff can update rules without IT intervention. This would reduce manual checks, streamline reviews, and improve user confidence in the accuracy of system validations. | Business Rules and Edits | Edits in the budgeting systems (F-195, F-200) are sometimes unclear, inconsistent, or misaligned with actual business rules. SME explained that edits are often used interchangeably with “business rules,” and in some cases, edits force unnecessary manual checks against prior-year values. This inconsistency increases workload for staff, creates confusion for districts, and reduces confidence in the system’s error-checking functionality. | Data Collection | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006ENR | The system must display edits in a clear, user-friendly way, highlighting critical errors. Submissions should be blocked until critical edits are resolved, and comments must be meaningful. School-level edit visibility should also be considered. | Edit process not effective | Districts are required to run edits before submission, but often they don’t review them carefully. Some districts provide placeholder comments without addressing the discrepancies. This reduces the quality of enrollment data and pushes the burden to OSPI staff. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006EXP | The system must include automated notification workflows tied to status changes (system open, submission received, edits required, approval completed). Notifications should be configurable by user role and include both email and in-system alerts. This reduces manual communication overhead, improves timeliness, and ensures districts/ESDs have clear visibility into status changes. | Manual Notifications (System Open, Submission Status) | Notifications such as system opening, submission readiness, and approvals are currently sent via manual emails. This increases administrative overhead and creates potential for delays or missed deadlines. | Data Collection | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006PRS | The system should provide automated notifications via email, dashboard alerts, or SMS integration. For example, when the system opens for the year, all districts should receive a system-generated notice. If a district misses a submission cutoff, automated reminders should trigger. These alerts should be configurable to reduce manual follow-up by OSPI staff. | Manual Notifications to Districts/ESDs | Notifications to school districts and ESDs — such as opening of the reporting year or reminders for late submissions — are still handled manually. SME sends emails or calls districts when deadlines approach. This consumes staff time, creates delays, and risks districts missing deadlines if communication is inconsistent. This was noted in 2018 and persists today | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006SAFS | The new Apportionment System must adopt a secure, modern login process, such as Entra ID or federated authentication. Users from districts or ESDs should be able to access the system seamlessly with individual credentials. | Desired future state login process | IT Application Services Director wants the new Apportionment System to utilize Entra ID or similar as a customer login process in order to provide a user-friendly, highly secure user management system. Those customers would log into OSPI a little differently than with the current process: either we federate the districts or district/ESD users come in individually in another way. | Data Collection | All | Feature | Technical | NaN | NaN |
| 006TRB | The system should provide a unified data model and shared access framework to ensure that all teams use the same authoritative source. Standardized reporting and integration across systems will reduce duplication, eliminate inconsistencies, and increase trust in outputs. | Data Silos & Inconsistent Use of S-275 Data | Different OSPI teams pull S-275 and related data in different ways, often resulting in inconsistent outputs and interpretations. This lack of standardization undermines confidence in the data and forces additional reconciliation work across departments. | Data Collection | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007BUD | The system must replace Access-based reporting with a modern, secure, and scalable solution. A centralized data mart or SQL-based repository should store F-195 data, with self-service reporting capabilities provided through a user-friendly visualization tool such as Tableau. This would allow districts, unions, and OSPI to filter, query, and analyze data without technical barriers, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and long-term sustainability of reporting. | Reliance on Outdated Access Files for F-195 Reporting | F-195 budget reporting outputs are currently generated as Microsoft Access database files. SME noted that this is a legacy approach, prone to corruption, and requires manual intervention to create and distribute. Access is no longer a supported platform for enterprise reporting, and its limitations prevent flexible, modern analysis. School districts and unions depend on these files for extracting program-level and object-level data, but the process is cumbersome and risks inconsistencies year to year, especially when item codes or formulas change. \n\nA CSV file format would be better in the future. It would allow for the front end user to have access to all the data on back-end | Data Collection | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007ENR | The system should give OSPI the ability to enforce program/school-level validation rules – limiting what type of enrollment can be reported at a given school type (e.g., Open Doors in R-schools, Skill Centers only at designated schools). This could include limiting the grades that can be reported to specific schools (e.g., Kindergarten reported at a high school). | Missing school-level validations | Currently, districts can submit logically inconsistent enrollments, such as non-Skill Center FTE at a skill center. These errors go undetected until OSPI staff review reports manually, delaying correction. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007EXP | The system must support direct online submission of F-185 reports by ESDs with validation and edits built in. It should allow aggregation within the system, generate standard reports, and integrate ESD data into federal reporting calculations. This eliminates manual Excel handling, ensures consistency, and improves data quality before OSPI staff receive files. | F-185 Reporting by ESDs (Excel Driven, No Edits) | ESDs currently complete F-185 in Excel templates with no built-in edits. SME aggregates their submissions manually via Tableau and Excel joins. The process is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks quality control. | Data Collection | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007SAFS | The system must allow OSPI’s Enrollment and Institutions team to lock Enrollment Reporting (P-223) Enrollment, SAFS ALE, and K–3 Class Size data during specific processing cycles. External users will be restricted from modifying data while OSPI is performing calculations. Lock periods will typically last up to three days each month. | Lock Enrollment data after a certain point | Program Supervisor of Enrollment & Institutions wants a way to lock the Enrollment Reporting (P-223) Enrollment, SAFS ALE, and K-3 Class Size to prevent external users from updating data in those systems, during the monthly cycles (of up to three days) while OSPI is processing enrollment, so that calculations aren't affected by new information. | Data Collection | ALE\nK-3 Class Size\nEnrollment Reporting (P-223) | Feature | Enrollment | NaN | NaN |
| 008ENR | The new system must integrate ALE and P223 collections. Submissions should be cross-validated automatically, with discrepancies flagged immediately for districts before final submission. | Manual reconciliation between P223 and ALE | OSPI staff must manually compare P223 and ALE data collections to ensure counts match. When mismatches occur, staff must email districts and request corrections. This is repetitive, slow, and prone to oversight. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 008PRS | The system should support configurable edit rules with different enforcement levels. Certain errors should block submission until resolved, while others may remain as warnings. This would improve data quality while still allowing flexibility. A dashboard for tracking unresolved edits should also be provided, so districts know exactly what requires attention. | Data Validation and Edit Limitations | SME described three levels of edits: (1) format-level checks (blocking), (2) warnings, and (3) errors. While format errors stop processing, warnings and errors do not — meaning flawed data can pass through the system. In practice, many edits serve only as advisory, and OSPI must rely on districts to self-correct. This reduces data quality and creates inconsistencies across districts. | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 008SAFS | The system must standardize item codes across budgeting (F195, F196, Estimate for State Revenues (Estimate for State Revenues (F-203)) and payment (Apportionment) systems. Currently, inconsistent coding leads to confusion and manual corrections. A unified coding structure will minimize errors and reduce time spent reconciling data. Standardization will also support smoother cross-system data integration and reporting. | Coding inconsistencies between systems must be resolved | The budgeting and payment system presently has numerous item codes that differ between the systems but have the same meaning. Resolving these differences will reduce errors and time spent creating files. | Data Collection | All | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 009ENR | The new system must support electronic batch uploads for ALE data, allowing districts to upload files rather than manually entering records. | Lack of electronic uploads for ALE | If ALE remains its own collection, districts are forced to manually key data into the system one district at a time. This is tedious and error-prone, especially for large districts with multiple ALE programs. | Data Collection | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 009PRS | The system should include automated reconciliation workflows for mismatched records. Exception dashboards should flag conflicts (e.g., mismatched SSN, name changes) and route them to the appropriate OSPI team for timely resolution. Data synchronization between S-275 and eCertification should be near real time to minimize errors. \n | eCertification System Integration Issues | SME explained that S-275 and the eCertification system share common fields like Social Security numbers. In the past, mismatches caused frequent reconciliation issues, though improvements have reduced the volume to only a handful per year. Still, when mismatches occur, OSPI certification staff must manually resolve them, sometimes taking weeks. This creates frustration for districts and delays in record acceptance. | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 011SAFS | Currently, districts are identified in SAFS using the CCDDD (County/District number), which does not distinguish special cases, requiring manual adjustments in Excel. The system shall provide the capability to identify and reclassify exceptions for specialized institutions such as Charter Schools, Tribal Schools, and Juvenile Detention Schools within the apportionment system. It shall automate the process of converting monthly payment and compensation increase data from revenue codes to appropriate AFRS budget codings, using appropriation codes matched to school identifiers. This automation shall replace the current manual Excel-based process and ensure accurate, fund-specific reporting for all school types. | Charter School and Compensation Increase calculation exceptions must be automated | Monthly payment data is converted from revenue codes displayed on reports to AFRS budget coding. And because Charter Schools are paid out of a different fund most of their payments need to be removed from each revenue code and combined into a different budget coding. This is also similar to the compensation increase budget coding. | Data Collection | All | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 012SAFS | The system must enforce data-entry validation rules for all integer fields. When entering numbers, users may input digits only, and the system should automatically display commas for readability once data entry is complete. Attempts to exceed the permitted digit limit should trigger an error message. This control minimizes data entry errors and ensures consistent numeric formatting throughout the system. | Masks for integer fields | When the focus is on an integer field, the system will refuse anything typed by the user except numbers. When the user tabs from the field, the system will display commas in the appropriate places. So if the field type is 9 integer, then the max field length would be 11 (nine digits plus two commas). If the user happens to type 11 digits and no commas, the system displays an error message. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 013SAFS | The system must validate decimal inputs by allowing only digits and one decimal point within the field. Users may not exceed the configured number of decimal places or total digits. If invalid input is detected, the system must display a clear, human-readable error message. This feature maintains data precision and consistency for all numeric fields requiring decimals. | Masks for decimal fields | When the focus is in a decimal number field, the system will ignore anything typed by the user except numbers and the decimal. The system will ignore anything typed after the maximum number of decimal places allowed. So, if the field type is 9.2 decimal, then the max field length would be 14 (nine digits, two commas, one period, two more digits). If the user happens to enter something other than what is allowed, such as 14 digits, the system will display an error message. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 014SAFS | The system must display calculated values on data entry or reporting screens but restrict users from editing them. These read-only fields should be visually distinct, such as by using a shaded background. This ensures users can view system-derived values for verification while maintaining data integrity. | Display of calculated fields | A field that contains a value derived from a system calculation is displayed on the appropriate data input or report page but cannot be edited by the user. Such fields are indicated by a physical differentiation, such as the presence of a grey background. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 015SAFS | When users save partially completed data, the system must still display calculated field values based on available information. Even if some components of the calculation are missing, the display should show interim results after clicking “Save” or “Save and Return.” | Displaying calculated fields when component data are not complete | Fields that include a value that is derived from a system calculation should, once the ‘Save’ or ‘Save and Return’ button has been clicked, show the calculated value, even if not all fields that contribute to that sum have been populated. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 016SAFS | The system must ensure all numeric data fields and report outputs are aligned by decimal place. Decimal alignment supports readability and consistency across all screens and printed reports. This requirement applies to both input and display formats. | Number values must decimal align | Numeric fields on data input screens, and displays in reports, must decimal align. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 017SAFS | All negative numeric values must display with a minus sign placed directly before the number (e.g., “−201,050.00”). Negative numbers must appear in red font for quick identification. This format ensures clarity and consistency across all reports and visual displays. It reduces confusion when interpreting financial and analytical data. | Negative numbers are expressed with a minus sign [-] printed to their left when displayed in reports | Negative numbers in reports and displays are expressed with a minus sign [-] printed to their left, so as to maintain decimal alignment. e.g.$ -201,050.00. Negative numbers must be displayed in red font. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 018SAFS | The system must standardize date entry, display, and storage formats for accuracy and usability. Dates must be stored as MMDDYYYY and displayed with slashes (MM/DD/YYYY), regardless of input format variations such as MM.DD.YYYY. For month/year-only fields, the system must retain MMYYYY and display it accordingly. This uniformity improves data compatibility and user experience across all modules. | Entry, display, and retention of dates | Wherever a date that includes the day of the month is required (as opposed to a Month/Year), the date must be retained as MMDDYYYY. When displayed, slashes ("/") will be inserted between the Month and Day, and Day and Year.\nUsers may enter the month as MMDDYYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, MM,DD,YYYY or MM.DD.YYYY.\nWherever a date that does not include the day of the month is required, they must be retained as MMYYYY. This value will be displayed either as Month, Year (in one or two fields) or MM/YYYY, as described in the User Interface specification.\nDepending on the User Interface specification, Months may be selected from a dropdown menu or entered as MM. Years may be selected from a dropdown menu or entered as YYYY. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 019SAFS | When a user saves data, the system must automatically perform field-level edits, refresh calculated fields, and store the latest values. Clicking “Save” keeps the user on the same screen, while “Save and Return” navigates back to the previous view. This behavior promotes workflow efficiency and consistency. Users receive immediate feedback on data validity while maintaining control of navigation. | Actions triggered by clicking ‘Save’ or ‘Save and Return’ | When the user clicks ‘Save’ or ‘Save and Return’ on a data entry page, the system runs field-level edits, updates calculated fields, and save his or her changes.\nIf the user clicked 'Save', the same screen continues to be displayed.\nIf the user clicked 'Save and Return', the previous screen then displays. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 020SAFS | If a user attempts to leave a page with unsaved changes, the system must prompt them to confirm their action. A clear warning message should inform users that unsaved data will be lost unless saved first. | Action triggered by navigating away from a page with unsaved data | If the user attempts to navigate away from a page without having saved any changes they've made in the current session, the system must display a message asking whether they want to continue the process and lose their data, or if they want to save their changes. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 021SAFS | The system must permit multiple users to view or access the same page or table concurrently. If a user makes a change while another user is viewing the same data, the system must alert the second user and provide an option to review the latest updates. | Multiple Users Accessing a Page or Table Simultaneously | The system must permit multiple users to access a page or table at the same time. If a user is viewing a page when another user makes a change to it, the system shall alert and permit the user to review changes made by the other user, and prioritize which changes to save. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 022SAFS | The system must accommodate access for third-party vendors who perform fiscal management and SAFS reporting on behalf of school districts. These vendors should have permissions aligned with the districts they serve, allowing them to view or edit relevant financial data. Access controls must ensure vendors can only interact with authorized district records. | Most districts contract some SAFS work to third-party vendors | Most of Washington's districts contract with third-party vendors to assist with fiscal decision making, security, and SAFS reporting services. As such, they will require system licenses and access and visibility to at least some districts' financial records, once granted permission by that district. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | Technical | NaN | NaN |

| 024SAFS | Each component within the Apportionment System (such as F195, Budget Extension Statement (F-200), and Enrollment Reporting (P-223)) must share a consistent user experience and visual design. The interface should maintain uniform navigation, data entry patterns, and reporting layouts. | Common UX across components | Each component of the Apportionment system must employ a common UX and cohesive, shared design language where possible to provide data-driven screen, reports, perform calculations and run edits. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 025SAFS | The system must employ common calculation methods, rounding rules, and business logic across all modules where applicable. This consistency eliminates discrepancies between components like F195, Budget Extension Statement (F-200), and Enrollment Reporting (P-223). Shared calculation frameworks enhance reliability and simplify maintenance. Standardizing logic also reduces testing effort and improves data reconciliation across the Apportionment ecosystem. | Common calculation processes across components | Each component of the Apportionment system must employ common calculations, rounding, business logic, and edit functionality to the degree practical. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 026SAFS | The system must dynamically retrieve and generate data when a screen or report is accessed, ensuring that users always see current information.

The progress bar should indicate the time remaining and status of the task. | Any processing that takes more than 10 seconds to perform requires a progress bar | Any automated process (such as creating a PDF file or importing data) that is expected to take more than 10 seconds must display a progress bar with an estimate of the time remaining. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 032SAFS | Error messages must be clear, descriptive, and easily understood by users without specialized technical knowledge. This includes file upload errors, validation issues, or calculation problems. | Human readable error messaging | In contrast to the existing system, error messaging--particularly for file inputs--must be interpretable by a human with no special system knowledge. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 033SAFS | The system must be capable of handling large file uploads in a single process without requiring multiple submissions. Currently, users must re-upload large datasets several times to complete validations. Improved capacity will streamline workflows and ensure efficiency in high-volume data environments. | Capacity to accept large files | In contrast to the existing system, large input files must be accepted by the system in a single process. Currently, it is necessary to submit large files multiple times in order for all all validations to run. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 034SAFS | The system must enforce a common file format for all incoming data submissions across external systems. This will replace the current inconsistent formats that require multiple mappings. Standardized formatting simplifies integration, reduces errors, and accelerates processing. | Consistent Format/Layout of Data Input | The system currently accepts data from multiple external systems, each of which has its own unique format. It is recommended that, where possible, Apportionment accepts a common file format that source systems adhere to. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 035SAFS | The system shall have the ability to retain and retrieve historical data submissions, maintaining at minimum three prior school years and the current year, and up to 25 years for specific data categories as required by reporting standards. It shall support version management, allowing users to access, compare, and select from previously saved versions of reports such as enrollment and budget data. Historical data must be available through an integrated archival and retrieval process, replacing legacy paper or file-based method | History of Data Submissions | The current system does not retain history of data submissions: once data has been submitted, you cannot get to the previously submitted data. It is recommended an archive/historical data retrevial process be implemented. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 036SAFS | The system must allow users, such as ESDs or vendors, to upload data files that contain information for one or multiple districts simultaneously. | Incoming data can include one or many districts | Some external users (e.g., ESDs, contracted district vendors) work with multiple districts' Apportionment Data, and would benefit from having the ability to submit data from those multiple districts in a single data exchange. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 037SAFS | Authorized external users (e.g., ESDs or contracted vendors) must have the ability to create, read, update, and delete specific apportionment data records before submission to OSPI. The system should provide audit trails for all changes to ensure accountability. Users must also receive reminders to align updates with source systems. | CRUD Capacity for some external user types | Some external users (e.g., ESDs, contracted district vendors) provide support by reviewing Apportionment data files before sending them to OSPI. Such users would benefit from a viewing/editing console to help quality control, and for tracking who's submitted. If the system provides such a feature to update an extracted file before it goes to OSPI, there needs to be a report listing the changes, and also a reminder to update the information in the same way within the system of origin. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 038SAFS | When any report or data file is uploaded, both the submitting entity and the corresponding district must receive confirmation of receipt. This ensures that districts have visibility into their data submissions, even if completed by vendors. | Import receipts to district, regardless of who files district's report | While the entity that sends an Apportionment file to OSPI receives confirmation that the file has been received, districts sometimes report via their district vendors that they can't see their data in the OSPI systems. It would be helpful for the districts (and all involved) if the districts are sent confirmation that their files are accepted. | Data Collection | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |

| 140SAFS | The apportionment system shall support the Personnel Reporting (S-275) process, which provides an annual census of school district staffing based on an October 1 snapshot. The system shall collect and maintain data for all staff providing educational services, including both certificated and classified employees, as well as contracted personnel who serve during the school year. The Personnel Reporting (S-275) module shall distinguish between certificated and non-certificated staff as required by OSPI reporting standards. Unlike enrollment data, which is captured monthly, Personnel Reporting (S-275) staffing data shall be collected annually to provide an accurate count of personnel and support statewide analysis of staffing trends, compliance, and funding considerations. | Personnel Reporting (S-275) System purpose | The Personnel Reporting (S-275) provides an annual census of school district staffing, based on an October 1 snapshot. This data tells OSPI who is providing educational services--all staff, not just certificated, although there are differences between certificated and other staff. Tracks both hired and contracted staff, who provide their services anywhere during the school year. In contrast to the Personnel Reporting (S-275)'s once a year educator count, enrollment is counted once a month because it's more dynamic, and because schools are directly funded based on the student count, not the staffing count. | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting (S-275) | Business Rule | Staffing Data | NaN | NaN |
| 141SAFS | The apportionment system shall recognize that staff hired after the October 1 snapshot date are not included in the Personnel Reporting (S-275) staffing report but shall still have their salary and expenditure data captured within the F-196 module. The system shall not allow post–October 1 staffing adjustments to the Personnel Reporting (S-275) dataset, as the snapshot represents a fixed annual record. It shall also support and display expected variances between employee counts in the Personnel Reporting (S-275) and F-196 modules, since districts are funded based on student enrollment rather than staffing levels. | Employees added after Personnel Reporting (S-275)'s October 1 snapshot | If staff are hired after October 1, they are not included on the Personnel Reporting (S-275), but their salaries are captured on the Annual Financial Statement (F-196) regardless. Schools cannot make adjustments to that annual snapshot; they are funded by the students they serve, not the educators that serve them. As such, employee counts in the Annual Financial Statement (F-196) and the Personnel Reporting (S-275) will often not match--and that's OK. | Data Collection | Personnel Reporting (S-275) | Business Rule | Staffing Data | NaN | NaN |

| 002SAFS | The Apportionment System must allow OSPI to aggregate and disaggregate district-level financial data to facilitate comprehensive reporting. The system should replace manual Excel-based aggregation processes with automated, coded data integration from F-196 and other sources. Users must be able to combine and separate data for reporting at the district, ESD, and school levels. | Support data aggregation and disaggregation for reporting | OSPI is in the early stages of a process by which we'll be able to identify all EDS data by codes, taking what was an Excel based-system to aggregate Annual Financial Statement data with less manual processing. As such, OSPI wants an easy Apportionment System function that aggregates data from the districts to create the report in the format that we want. Authorized users could then crosswalk all ESD and District data, aggregate it for our reports, then disaggregate it to the school level for DOE and Census. | Data Calculation | All | Epic | NaN | NaN | NaN |

| 011SAFS | Currently, districts are identified in SAFS using the CCDDD (County/District number), which does not distinguish special cases, requiring manual adjustments in Excel. The system shall provide the capability to identify and reclassify exceptions for specialized institutions such as Charter Schools, Tribal Schools, and Juvenile Detention Schools within the apportionment system. It shall automate the process of converting monthly payment and compensation increase data from revenue codes to appropriate AFRS budget codings, using appropriation codes matched to school identifiers. This automation shall replace the current manual Excel-based process and ensure accurate, fund-specific reporting for all school types. | Charter School and Compensation Increase calculation exceptions must be automated | Monthly payment data is converted from revenue codes displayed on reports to AFRS budget coding. And because Charter Schools are paid out of a different fund most of their payments need to be removed from each revenue code and combined into a different budget coding. This is also similar to the compensation increase budget coding. | Data Calculation | All | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |

Dates must be stored as MMDDYYYY and displayed with slashes (MM/DD/YYYY), regardless of input format variations such as MM.DD.YYYY. For month/year-only fields, the system must retain MMYYYY and display it accordingly. This uniformity improves data compatibility and user experience across all modules. | Entry, display, and retention of dates | Wherever a date that includes the day of the month is required (as opposed to a Month/Year), the date must be retained as MMDDYYYY. When displayed, slashes ("/") will be inserted between the Month and Day, and Day and Year.\nUsers may enter the month as MMDDYYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, MM,DD,YYYY or MM.DD.YYYY.\nWherever a date that does not include the day of the month is required, they must be retained as MMYYYY. This value will be displayed either as Month, Year (in one or two fields) or MM/YYYY, as described in the User Interface specification.\nDepending on the User Interface specification, Months may be selected from a dropdown menu or entered as MM. Years may be selected from a dropdown menu or entered as YYYY. | Data Calculation | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |

Standardized reporting and integration across systems will reduce duplication, eliminate inconsistencies, and increase trust in outputs. | Data Silos & Inconsistent Use of S-275 Data | Different OSPI teams pull S-275 and related data in different ways, often resulting in inconsistent outputs and interpretations. This lack of standardization undermines confidence in the data and forces additional reconciliation work across departments. | Data Calculation | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001SAFS | The system must provide reporting functionality that enables OSPI’s Apportionment team to analyze and respond to legislative requests for details on maintenance-level budget drivers | Support planning maintenance-level budget | The system must provide a report to support OSPI's apportionment team to respond to the legislature's requests for information about the drivers of the maintenance-level budget. | Data Calculation | All | Epic | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 009SAFS | The system must clearly distinguish audit adjustments within reports by showing when and how each change occurred. Currently, adjustments overwrite prior values without context, making audit trails unclear. The improved design should log adjustment dates, sources, and rationales. | Audit-driven changes must be made clearer | When audit adjustments are made, they are added into the adjustment column displayed on a report. When adjustments are made to adjust from the prior year both values have to be added together manually. There is no way to see when each adjustment is made; the values are just replaced with new ones. It makes it difficult to see the month in which these occur without the backup saved each month. Normalizing this process will save time and reduce errors. | Data Calculation | All | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 010SAFS | All report calculations currently performed through external macros must be integrated into the Apportionment System. Doing so eliminates dependency on outdated 16-bit macro program and manual workarounds. The system should execute these calculations natively to produce district-level PDFs and other outputs. | Calculations must be brought into the system | Numerous reports are still calculated outside of the Apportionment system, using old macros to generate PDF reports for each district. The macro was programed using 16-bit which requires OSPI to use an old computer to run these reports. Normalizing this process will save time and reduce errors. | Data Calculation | All | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 027SAFS | Screens that allow users to create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) formulae must include clear display elements such as formula name, type, expression, item code, and calculation order. These elements provide transparency into how calculations are configured and executed. Authorized users can easily diagnose issues or verify calculation setups. | Display elements for formulae | The screens on which authorized users CRUD formulas must provide a Name, Type (e.g., Mathematical Formula), Expression (the formula itself), an Item Code, and a control to order the formulae for calculations, so that the user can see how the system is setup and can diagnose issues. | Data Calculation | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 072SAFS | The system must provide an optional function to calculate apportionment funding at the individual school level, not only the district level. | Calculate by school as well as district | The system must optionally calculate apportionment by school in addition to district. | Data Calculation | All | Non-Funct Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 094SAFS | The system shall have the ability to forecast and display year-end balances for all school districts by the end of June. It shall automatically calculate projections using monthly apportionment data, including the final two months of the prior school year and current-year enrollment trends. The system shall provide a reporting option that enables users to toggle between SAFS fiscal year (July–June) and district fiscal year (September–August) views, ensuring flexibility for both audit and operational planning. | Forecast year-end balances by end of June | To help the Apportionment team visualize fiscal year appropriations, the system should provide the ability to forecast districts' remaining balances by the end of June. This calculation should include the final two months of the prior school year, which (along with every other month) takes into consideration the current enrollment to recalculate the annual allotment. This is calculated manually at this time, using a spreadsheet that contains all of last year's data. | Data Calculation | Annual Financial Statement (F-196) | Non-Funct Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 103SAFS | The system must support the ability to run calculations for multiple districts at once, improving efficiency during large-scale financial processing. | Process calculations for multiple districts simultaneously | The system must provide the ability to process calculations for multiple districts simultaneously. | Data Calculation | Budget Extension Statement (F-200) | Non-Funct Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 107SAFS | The system shall have the ability to adjust monthly apportionment percentages to accommodate short payments when full disbursement is not possible. It shall enable OSPI apportionment staff to set, record, and track temporary reductions and automatically calculate corresponding make-up payments in subsequent months. The system shall maintain an audit trail showing the adjustment reason, date, and reconciliation details for each affected district. | Support 'short payment' adjustments to monthly allotment #% | School Apportionments are typically allotted each month by a fixed percentage, ranging from 5 - 12.5%, of the whole. Under certain circumstances, the system must support apportionment staff altering the apportionment % for a given school district and month. | Data Calculation | Estimate for State Revenues (Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) | Non-Funct Req | Budgets Data | NaN | NaN |
| 002APP | The new solution must be designed to process apportionment calculations significantly faster, ideally within one hour, and without locking staff out of the system during processing. This requires scalable system architecture capable of handling large datasets efficiently while supporting concurrent operations. Reducing calculation time and enabling parallel activity will improve productivity, allow staff to verify results sooner, and ensure timely payments to districts. | Long Processing Times for Calculations | One of the most critical issues raised is system performance. Running apportionment calculations can take between four to six hours, during which time staff are locked out of making other updates. This bottleneck delays downstream processes such as report verification and compliance adjustments. SME noted that this not only slows monthly processing but also creates stress during peak deadlines when timely funding distributions are critical. | Data Calculation | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003APP | The apportionment system should allow staff to run calculations for specific subsets of districts (e.g., only charter schools or selected districts) in addition to statewide runs. It should also support running multiple calculations in parallel to accommodate testing scenarios or partial recalculations. This flexibility will save staff considerable time and reduce the burden of processing one district at a time, ensuring that recalculations can be targeted and efficient. | Annual Carryover Recovery Outside the System | The system restricts staff to processing calculations either for all school districts or one at a time. It does not allow selective runs, such as calculating only for charter schools or a subset of districts. This limitation adds considerable manual work, especially when staff need to test or reprocess smaller groups. The lack of flexibility contributes to inefficiency and prolongs processing cycles. | Data Calculation | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004APP | The system must automatically map revenue codes to budget codes, eliminating the current reliance on Excel spreadsheets. This functionality should be configurable to adjust for legislative or budgetary changes without requiring manual intervention each month. Automating the crosswalk will reduce errors, standardize reporting, and provide greater confidence in the data submitted to the Budget Office and other stakeholders. | Manual Compilation of Reports in Adobe | After calculations, staff must manually convert revenue codes into budget codes using Excel spreadsheets before reports can be shared with the Budget Office. This manual crosswalk is time-consuming and prone to human error. It represents a critical control point that should be automated within the system to improve accuracy and reduce redundant handling of financial data. | Data Calculation | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005APP | All compliance-related calculations that are currently performed using standalone Excel tools should be integrated into the apportionment system. This includes Learning Assistance Program (LAP) allocations, High Poverty calculations, Physical/Social/Emotional Support (PSES) compliance, and K-3 class size compliance. Incorporating these tools will provide a single source of truth for funding calculations, reduce risk from undocumented or unsupported spreadsheets, and allow for real-time updates and error checking within the system itself. | ADA Compliance for Reports | A significant number of compliance-related calculations are performed outside of the apportionment system using Excel-based tools. SME described how programs like the Learning Assistance Program (LAP), High Poverty, Physical/Social/Emotional Support (PSES), and Kindergarten–3rd Grade (K-3) class size compliance require manual updates and re-uploads into the apportionment system. These tools were inherited and not fully documented, creating risks when they break or require troubleshooting. Integrating these functions into the system would minimize errors and improve sustainability. | Data Calculation | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| NaN | The system must include built-in functionality to process carryover recovery annually, using F-196 data directly rather than relying on external spreadsheets. By automating this once-a-year process, the system will ensure consistency, reduce the risk of manual miscalculation, and provide clearer audit trails. This will also allow districts to view and verify recovery calculations in real time, improving transparency and accountability. | NaN | At year-end, carryover recovery must be processed using external spreadsheets. Data from F-196 reports, provided by finance staff, is compared against district expenditures, and unspent funds are clawed back. SME explained that this once-a-year process is entirely manual, requiring reconciliation outside the apportionment system before uploading adjustments. This introduces inefficiencies and potential audit risks. | Data Calculation | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002BUD | The system must allow authorized OSPI staff to adjust F-197 balances and item codes directly through a controlled user interface, with full audit logging to track changes. This would eliminate reliance on IT staff for routine balance corrections, reduce turnaround times for resolving errors, and ensure that financial data used by districts, ESDs, and OSPI is always accurate and up to date. | Inability to Correct Values Without IT Support (F197 & F200) | SME frequently encounters issues where balances (e.g., beginning fund balances in F197) do not roll forward correctly. Currently, he cannot change many item codes himself and must request IT to manually fix errors. SME explained that balances frequently fail to roll forward correctly from the prior year, and many of the item codes are locked for editing. This means that even simple corrections—sometimes for small dollar amounts—require OSPI staff to call IT support. Such dependency results in days of delays, creates unnecessary workload for IT, and prevents timely resolution of errors. This limitation undermines OSPI’s ability to reconcile balances quickly and to keep financial reporting accurate. | Data Calculation | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004BUD | The system must automatically detect and apply the most recent F-200 submission for each district and fund when updating appropriations. Historical submissions should remain archived for audit purposes, but only the latest submission should feed into current year budget calculations and F-196 actuals. This ensures consistency, accuracy, and transparency in budget reporting, even when multiple extensions are submitted throughout the year. | Limited Transparency into F-200 History and Difficulty Managing Multiple F-200 (Budget Extension) Submissions | Districts frequently submit multiple F-200 budget extensions within the same fiscal year—for example, one in November due to levy revenues and another in March due to grants. Historically, the system struggled to identify which extension was the “most current” for reporting purposes. This created confusion in applying appropriation values and resulted in reporting errors. Although partial fixes were made, SME emphasized that ensuring the system always selects the latest valid submission is critical for budget accuracy. | Data Calculation | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001ENR | The new system must calculate totals directly from source enrollment data in real time. Any discrepancies should be automatically flagged. The reporting engine should ensure consistency between displayed totals and exported data, eliminating manual reconciliation. | Reports not showing correct totals | During reporting, totals displayed on the screen sometimes don’t reflect actual student-level data. This occurs because the current system relies on cached calculations that may time out, resulting in zero or incomplete totals. Districts and OSPI staff then waste time reconciling mismatched numbers, and confidence in the system’s accuracy is eroded. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002ENR | The system must preserve original data when revisions are made. Revision forms must be pre-populated with prior values, and validations must block submission of “zero” revisions unless explicitly intended. | Revisions erase previously reported numbers | When districts create a revision and hit “Save,” sometimes all numbers in the file are zeroed out due to system slowness. This not only forces resubmission but also risks OSPI unknowingly processing blank files, which could lead to incorrect funding allocations. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003ENR | The system must maintain clear separation between original files and revisions. Only the selected revision should be deleted, and a confirmation step plus audit log must protect original submissions. | Deleting a revised file deletes the original | Staff noted that deleting a faulty revision sometimes also deletes the original baseline file. This creates data integrity risks and could erase official enrollment counts needed for auditing and apportionment. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0011ENR | The system must automate apportionment file preparation. It should calculate FTEs and generate apportionment-ready outputs in the required formats, eliminating reliance on manual Excel work. | Manual apportionment file preparation | Currently, SME and others manually extract data, run pivot tables in Excel, and build text files for apportionment. This process is inefficient, repetitive, and highly error-prone. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002TRB | The system must enforce policy-driven retention schedules and automate the secure archiving or deletion of records in accordance with RIM rules. This will reduce database load, improve performance, and ensure compliance with state and federal audit standards. | Absence of Automated Record Retention / Destruction | The current system does not have automated record retention or destruction processes in place. Over time, this creates large, unmanageable datasets and raises compliance concerns since OSPI is required to adhere to strict records management (RIM) rules. The lack of automation leaves staff with the burden of manually managing records, which increases the risk of errors and missed compliance deadlines. | Data Calculation | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003TRB | The new system should provide direct database access, user-defined fields, and no-code calculation capabilities to minimize reliance on manual Excel work. It should also include built-in data normalization features to streamline reporting and reduce the risk of discrepancies. | Reliance on Manual Excel Processing & Error-Prone Workflows | Much of the work today depends on exporting Excel files, cleaning them, and creating temporary databases. This reliance on manual processes increases errors, limits scalability, and consumes staff time that could otherwise be spent on higher-value analysis. It also leads to duplicate efforts when different teams rebuild similar datasets for their own reporting. | Data Calculation | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004TRB | The system should provide a dedicated sandbox environment that allows for safe testing of new formulas, legislative updates, or code changes. This environment must mirror production data, ensuring accurate modeling without disrupting live operations. | No Sandbox Environment for Legislative Updates & Testing | When new legislation or policy changes impact apportionment formulas, SME and her team cannot test or simulate these updates within the system. Instead, they are forced to build and maintain large Excel-based models (“Mega” and “Mighty”), which are cumbersome, fragile, and prone to inaccuracies. This makes it difficult to provide timely, accurate feedback to policymakers. | Data Calculation | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001INT | The apportionment system must store data in a centralized relational database that retains both current and historical data in a consistent schema. Lookup tables for schools, account codes, and activity codes must be integrated, ensuring a single source of truth. This structure should support direct query, automated reporting, and the ability to generate dashboards without relying on manual Excel manipulations. | Data stored in Excel instead of a centralized database | Currently, critical apportionment and enrollment data is not housed in a centralized database but rather in disparate Excel files and extracts. SME explained that apportionment outputs only exist as Excel extracts stored on the S-Drive, which are inconsistent year over year. This leads to fragile processes, as the manual handling of files risks data corruption and makes it harder to build reliable dashboards. | Data Calculation | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005INT | The system should enforce schema stability and provide access to 10–20 years of historical data. Historical datasets must be retained in a standardized format, enabling longitudinal studies, forecasting, and legislative reporting without manual archival. | Data inconsistency across years and lack of historical depth | Apportionment extracts change column layouts from year to year, breaking queries and requiring SME to re-engineer Power Query steps. Additionally, prior-year retention is limited, with only recent data available (post-2019). This prevents long-term trend analysis and weakens forecasting capability. | Data Calculation | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003PRS | The system must centralize all calculations within a secure and auditable environment. This includes compliance ratios, apportionment metrics, and K-12 penalties. Automated workflows should pull enrollment data directly, apply standardized formulas, and generate results that can be traced and validated. Eliminating Excel/Access dependencies will ensure continuity if key staff leave and allow broader staff access to calculations. | Manual Calculations for Apportionment and Ratios | SME explained that while the S-275 system collects data, almost all calculations for staff-per-student ratios, compliance checks (K-3, K-12 penalties), and PSES staffing are performed outside the system in Excel or Access. Additionally, enrollment supervisor provides P223 files externally, which SME then uses for apportionment calculations. This separation from the core system introduces errors, requires specialized staff knowledge, and creates dependencies on spreadsheets that are not scalable or auditable. | Data Calculation | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 064SAFS | The system must generate real-time updates of Recovery and Carryover data, replacing manual spreadsheet updates. | Generate real-time displays of recovery and carryover spreadsheet data | Provide a feature in the system that automatically updates the Recovery and Carryover Spreadsheet Tool so that districts will have real-time data. | Data Calculation | All | Non-Funct Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 113SAFS | The system must store confirmed monthly enrollment counts as point-in-time data for future reporting and analysis. Reports should be based on confirmed counts to ensure consistency. | Use confirmed monthly enrollment counts as point-in-time data | The system must store confirmed monthly enrollment counts as point-in-time data. Update reports to use point-in-time confirmed monthly enrollment counts. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting (P-223) | Non-Funct Req | Enrollment Data | NaN | NaN |
| 003EXP | The system must automate federal reporting crosswalks by embedding mapping logic between the state chart of accounts and federal formats (F-33, NPEFS, SFFLS). It should allow OSPI staff to configure and maintain mapping rules, generate outputs in federally required formats, and update crosswalks as federal definitions evolve. This reduces manual rework, ensures accuracy, and accelerates compliance reporting. | Complex crosswalk for federal reporting (F-33, NPEFS, SFFLS) | OSPI’s chart of accounts differs from federal formats. SME must manually build crosswalks by pulling SQL data into Tableau, exporting to Excel, then re-exporting into custom Excel workbooks. This is highly inefficient and error-prone. | Data Calculation | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001TRB | The system must be enhanced to include a robust data warehouse that stores historical apportionment and financial data. This repository should support multi-year analysis, allow users to query past records without reloading files, and ensure easy traceability for audits and policy validation. | Lack of Historical Data Storage | The apportionment process currently operates more like a calculator, performing real-time calculations but without storing historical data. As a result, SME and her team must manually extract and compile years of Excel files to perform any trend analysis, forecasting, or validation. This is time-consuming, creates risks of data inconsistencies, and prevents efficient responses to legislative or district-level inquiries. | Data Calculation | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006INT | The system should support forecasting and trend analytics by retaining deep historical data and providing data models optimized for predictive reporting. Standardized schemas and consistent historical records will enable more robust analysis to support decision-makers. | Limited ability for forecasting and proactive analytics | Currently, SME can only report on what happened last year. Without structured, historical, and standardized data, forecasting trends such as levy collection or district financial health is difficult and time-intensive. This limits the ability to provide proactive insights for policy and decision-making. | Data Calculation | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001PRS | The new system must integrate with the confidentiality program database and automatically identify records flagged for redaction. Built-in logic should prevent unauthorized exposure by applying redactions before reports are published. Additionally, the system should maintain an audit trail of redactions to meet compliance requirements and reduce the reliance on individual staff expertise. | Manual Redaction of Confidential Records | The current S-275 process still relies on manual redaction of personally identifiable information for individuals in the Address Confidentiality Program. SME explained that certain records cannot be made public, requiring a manual step to identify and remove these from Access reports before publishing. This adds risk of oversight, introduces delays, and consumes staff resources, especially since confidential records must be verified against certification system data. This issue was first captured in 2018 and remains unresolved today. | Data Calculation | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005PRS | The future system must replace Access with a modern database or warehouse solution. Role-based security should allow multiple OSPI staff to run calculations, extract reports, and access data without bottlenecks. Centralizing the data in a supported environment will also enable integration with downstream systems and improve business continuity by reducing reliance on a single expert. | Dependence on Access Database for Staff Calculations | Staffing data is still processed and analyzed in Microsoft Access. SME described a workflow where district submissions are exported from EDS into Access, where queries and macros are run to prepare compliance and apportionment data. This approach restricts access to one SME and limits data availability to a small group. Access is also an aging technology with limited IT support, creating risk for long-term sustainability. | Data Calculation | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003INT | The apportionment system must include fully maintained lookup/reference tables for schools, accounts, and activity codes within the same database environment. This ensures that all reporting processes can directly query human-readable names alongside financial and enrollment data | Missing or fragmented reference data (codes, schools, activities) | When creating reports, SME must manually join data from multiple servers to resolve codes into meaningful labels (e.g., school names, activity names). This adds complexity, slows down report generation, and introduces opportunities for mismatched joins. | Data Calculation | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 008SAFS | The system must standardize item codes across budgeting (F195, F196, Estimate for State Revenues (Estimate for State Revenues (F-203)) and payment (Apportionment) systems. Currently, inconsistent coding leads to confusion and manual corrections. A unified coding structure will minimize errors and reduce time spent reconciling data. Standardization will also support smoother cross-system data integration and reporting. | Coding inconsistencies between systems must be resolved | The budgeting and payment system presently has numerous item codes that differ between the systems but have the same meaning. Resolving these differences will reduce errors and time spent creating files. | Data Calculation | All | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 019SAFS | When a user saves data, the system must automatically perform field-level edits, refresh calculated fields, and store the latest values. Clicking “Save” keeps the user on the same screen, while “Save and Return” navigates back to the previous view. This behavior promotes workflow efficiency and consistency. Users receive immediate feedback on data validity while maintaining control of navigation. | Actions triggered by clicking ‘Save’ or ‘Save and Return’ | When the user clicks ‘Save’ or ‘Save and Return’ on a data entry page, the system runs field-level edits, updates calculated fields, and save his or her changes.\nIf the user clicked 'Save', the same screen continues to be displayed.\nIf the user clicked 'Save and Return', the previous screen then displays. | Data Calculation | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 021SAFS | The system must permit multiple users to view or access the same page or table concurrently. If a user makes a change while another user is viewing the same data, the system must alert the second user and provide an option to review the latest updates. | Multiple Users Accessing a Page or Table Simultaneously | The system must permit multiple users to access a page or table at the same time. If a user is viewing a page when another user makes a change to it, the system shall alert and permit the user to review changes made by the other user, and prioritize which changes to save. | Data Calculation | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 068SAFS | The system must allow users to apply new item codes, funds, and formulae using a visual interface with checkboxes or dropdowns, rather than manual coding. | WYSIWG 'programming' for applying new funds, codes, formulae, etc. | When an item code, fund, or formula is added to the system, the user should be able to use checkboxes to indicate what processes to which it should apply | Data Calculation | All | Non-Funct Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 081SAFS | The system must support automated validation (edit) checks on district budget and revenue data across all funds, including General Fund and ASB Fund. These edits must run when triggered by a user and identify inconsistencies or errors before submission. | Budget (e.g., All funds, General Fund, ASB Fund) and Revenue edits | The system must run Budget (e.g., All funds, General Fund, ASB Fund) and Revenue edits against budgets, when requested by the user, through a submittal hierarchy culminating in “Approved” by OSPI. | Data Calculation | Budgeting and Accounting System (F-195) | Non-Funct Req | Budgets Data | NaN | NaN |
| 093SAFS | When revising prior-year Annual Financial Statement (F-196) data, the system must automatically incorporate the correct ot corrected indirect rate calculations. | Prior-Year Annual Financial Statement (F-196) revisions must include corrected indirect rate | Updates to a prior-year Annual Financial Statement (F-196) must incorporate the correct/corrected indirect rate calculation. | Data Calculation | Annual Financial Statement (F-196) | Non-Funct Req | Budgets Data | NaN | NaN |
| 110SAFS | The system shall provide OSPI SAFS staff with administrative controls to stop, cancel, or restart district-submitted revisions at any stage. When multiple overlapping or unfinished revisions exist, authorized OSPI users must be able to select and terminate specific revision instances without requiring district intervention or external scripting. The system shall include audit tracking of all stop/restart actions, including initiator, timestamp, and affected revision IDs. | Ability for OSPI SAFS Staff to stop and restart revisions | The system must provide ability for OSPI SAFS Staff to stop and restart revisions on demand. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting (P-223) | Non-Funct Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 129SAFS | The apportionment system shall allow school districts to copy an existing budget within the Budgeting and Accounting System (F-195) module to create up to two budgets for a given fiscal year. | Districts can copy an existing budget | Districts may copy an existing budgets in the Budgeting and Accounting System (F-195) portion of the apportionment system (to create two at most for a given year) in order to try other calculations to assist in their planning. | Data Calculation | Budgeting and Accounting System (F-195) | Business Rule | Budgets Data | NaN | NaN |
| 133SAFS | The apportionment system shall provide the Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) “’X’ option” functionality beginning in January each year, allowing school districts to model the revenue impact of changes to funding formula elements. The system shall prepopulate fields with “state constants,” representing OSPI’s best estimates for each district. Districts shall be able to modify these values to explore scenarios, plan contingencies, and optimize funding strategies. Submission of the Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) “’X’ option” to OSPI shall be optional, and the system shall clearly indicate that these forms are for internal modeling purposes only. | Estimate for State Revenues (Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) 'X Option' Purpose | Beginning in January of each year, OSPI makes available to school districts a section of the Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) called the “’X’ option”, which districts can use to model the revenue impact of changes to elements of the funding formula. The “’X’ option” contains prepopulated fields called “state constants”, which display the state’s best guesses for the values that will apply to each district (e.g., a 'sandbox'). The districts can overwrite these values to plan for contingencies and determine how to maximize their funding. Districts are not required to submit Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) “’X’ option” forms to OSPI. | Data Calculation | Estimate for State Revenues (Estimate for State Revenues (F-203) | Business Rule | Budgets Data | NaN | NaN |
| 0010ENR | The new system must digitize these collections, providing secure online forms for submission. Data must flow directly into the central system for reporting and apportionment calculations. \n | Paper-based collections still in use (E672, E525, P213, P223YC, UW enrollment) | Institutional Education (E672), Home/Hospital (E525), Non-High (P213), Washington Youth Academy (P223YC) and UW enrollment reports are still submitted via paper or email, then manually entered into spreadsheets. This adds workload and increases the chance of transcription errors. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0013ENR | The new system should maintain version control of submissions. Original monthly counts should be archived and accessible for audit purposes, even if later revisions occur. | Inconsistent data when revisions override confirmed counts | Earlier, OSPI staff noted that finalized monthly counts could be overwritten by later revisions, making it impossible to retrieve the original version. SME clarified this is less critical now, as final counts are accepted as authoritative, but some staff still see value in audit history. | Data Calculation | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0010PRS | The new system must provide robust ad hoc reporting tools with a user-friendly interface. Users should be able to filter, aggregate, and export staffing data without requiring database skills. Role-based permissions should control access to sensitive data fields, while still enabling flexible reporting for authorized users. This capability would empower staff across OSPI to self-serve and reduce bottlenecks on specialized personnel. | Lack of Ad Hoc Reporting Capability | SME described frequent ad hoc data requests that cannot be fulfilled directly in EDS. Instead, he manually extracts data from Access or Excel, creating custom datasets on demand. This is time-intensive and error-prone, and it prevents broader OSPI staff from accessing staffing data without SME intervention. | Data Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 0014ENR | The system must generate ADA-compliant reports by default. Interactive web reports or accessible PDFs should be provided, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards. | Non-ADA compliant reports | Reports posted on the web are static PDFs and not ADA compliant. This limits accessibility for users with disabilities and does not meet state and federal compliance standards. | Data Reporting | Enrollment Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001BUD | The system must migrate to a modern, database-driven architecture interactive front end. This should allow users (districts, ESDs, auditors, unions) to report data dynamically without reliance on Access or manual file handling. Historical data must be standardized and version-tracked so that cross-year comparisons remain valid even when formulas or item codes change. This self-service capability would streamline audit support, reduce IT workload, and ensure timely delivery of accurate financial information to auditors. | Manual and Outdated Systems (Access, Excel, Legacy Design) | Much of the financial reporting (F195/F197) relies on outdated tools such as Access databases, Excel spreadsheets, and early-1990s style processes. For example, Access files must be manually created and uploaded to OSPI’s site. Item dictionaries and formulas change year to year, creating inconsistencies in historical data. Districts and unions rely on these outputs but may not be aware of underlying calculation changes. This creates unnecessary bottlenecks and dependencies, especially during audit season when requests are frequent and time sensitive. The process adds delays, consumes IT bandwidth, and increases the risk of errors being introduced during hand-offs. | Data Reporting | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001EXP | The apportionment system must include a secure, cost-effective digital certification workflow that complies with OSPI and SAO approval standards. It should allow for flexible integration with digital signature platforms (e.g., Adobe, DocuSign) and ensure an auditable approval trail. This requirement reduces costs, eliminates paper, and ensures OSPI staff can validate certifications in real time without depending on costly external platforms. | Manual & fragmented certification/sign-off process | Previously, districts and ESDs mailed signed certification pages, which was replaced by DocuSign. While effective, SME noted DocuSign is expensive and may be excessive for the level of security needed. He suggested Adobe’s certificate-based signing could achieve the same outcome at lower cost. | Data Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001PRS | The new system must integrate with the confidentiality program database and automatically identify records flagged for redaction. Built-in logic should prevent unauthorized exposure by applying redactions before reports are published. Additionally, the system should maintain an audit trail of redactions to meet compliance requirements and reduce the reliance on individual staff expertise. | Manual Redaction of Confidential Records | The current S-275 process still relies on manual redaction of personally identifiable information for individuals in the Address Confidentiality Program. SME explained that certain records cannot be made public, requiring a manual step to identify and remove these from Access reports before publishing. This adds risk of oversight, introduces delays, and consumes staff resources, especially since confidential records must be verified against certification system data. This issue was first captured in 2018 and remains unresolved today. | Data Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 001TRB | The system must be enhanced to include a robust data warehouse that stores historical apportionment and financial data. This repository should support multi-year analysis, allow users to query past records without reloading files, and ensure easy traceability for audits and policy validation. | Lack of Historical Data Storage | The apportionment process currently operates more like a calculator, performing real-time calculations but without storing historical data. As a result, SME and her team must manually extract and compile years of Excel files to perform any trend analysis, forecasting, or validation. This is time-consuming, creates risks of data inconsistencies, and prevents efficient responses to legislative or district-level inquiries. | Data Reporting | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002PRS | The future system should generate ADA-compliant outputs by default. Reports should follow Section 508 and WCAG standards without manual intervention, ensuring accessibility for screen readers and other assistive technologies. By automating accessibility formatting, OSPI staff can focus on analysis rather than rework, and the agency can ensure consistent compliance with legal accessibility standards. | Manual ADA Compliance Updates | All public-facing reports must meet ADA accessibility requirements, but currently the formatting is applied manually by OSPI staff after generating Access/Excel outputs. SME confirmed that this process is not tied to a fixed monthly cycle but arises whenever reports are prepared, requiring repetitive adjustments such as table reformatting and accessible PDF conversion. This increases turnaround time and introduces inconsistency in accessibility compliance. | Data Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 002SAFS | The Apportionment System must allow OSPI to aggregate and disaggregate district-level financial data to facilitate comprehensive reporting. The system should replace manual Excel-based aggregation processes with automated, coded data integration from F-196 and other sources. Users must be able to combine and separate data for reporting at the district, ESD, and school levels. | Support data aggregation and disaggregation for reporting | OSPI is in the early stages of a process by which we'll be able to identify all EDS data by codes, taking what was an Excel based-system to aggregate Annual Financial Statement data with less manual processing. As such, OSPI wants an easy Apportionment System function that aggregates data from the districts to create the report in the format that we want. Authorized users could then crosswalk all ESD and District data, aggregate it for our reports, then disaggregate it to the school level for DOE and Census. | Data Reporting | All | Epic | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003EXP | The system must automate federal reporting crosswalks by embedding mapping logic between the state chart of accounts and federal formats (F-33, NPEFS, SFFLS). It should allow OSPI staff to configure and maintain mapping rules, generate outputs in federally required formats, and update crosswalks as federal definitions evolve. This reduces manual rework, ensures accuracy, and accelerates compliance reporting. | Complex crosswalk for federal reporting (F-33, NPEFS, SFFLS) | OSPI’s chart of accounts differs from federal formats. SME must manually build crosswalks by pulling SQL data into Tableau, exporting to Excel, then re-exporting into custom Excel workbooks. This is highly inefficient and error-prone. | Data Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 003SAFS | The system shall have the ability to integrate directly with the State of Washington’s One Washington (OneWA) platform to exchange payment and financial data. The system shall include an method of transmitting approved invoice and apportionment payment data, incorporating all OneWA-required data fields (e.g., SWV vendor identifiers and payment codes). The integration shall follow OneWA’s published interface and security specifications, ensuring seamless, automated payment initiation and reconciliation between the Apportionment and Workday systems | Provide connectivity between WorkDay and Apportionment | The system shall support direct integration with One Washington (One WA), Washington's cloud-based, enterprise-wide system for finance, procurement, budget, HR and payroll processesto exchange invoice and payment data, e.g., to transmit approved invoice data to One WA for payment processing. | Data Reporting | External Integrations | Epic | Technical | NaN | NaN |
| 004EXP | The system must empower OSPI staff with role-based administrative controls to manage rollover tasks, edit configurations, and update report templates without external support. This ensures greater agility, reduces costs, and allows staff to align system updates with workload cycles. Consultants should only be required for major upgrades or structural changes, not routine adjustments. | Reliance on Consultants for Rollover/System Changes | SME expressed frustration at relying on external consultants for even minor changes like adjusting formulas, edits, or report text. This dependence creates delays, raises costs, and limits flexibility. Internal staff lack the permissions or tools to perform basic updates. | Data Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004INT | The system must enable SQL-based stored procedures for core reporting needs, reducing reliance on R scripts and manual processing. This supports automation, improves reliability, and makes reporting auditable and repeatable. | Reports not structured as reusable stored procedures | Currently, SME uses R scripts to join, clean, and prepare data for Tableau visualizations. While functional, this approach lacks scalability and reusability. Routine reports could be encapsulated in SQL stored procedures for consistency, automation, and reduced maintenance. \n\nCustomer prefers fully automation of the scripts over the current system only if an internal SAFS staff member can have access to the code for maintenance and troubleshooting | Data Reporting | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 004SAFS | The system shall have the ability to prepare, load, and manage a four-year sandbox containing funds, rules, and budget assumptions used to simulate legislative impacts on the apportionment system. OSPI staff must be able to enter and update (e.g., enrollment, charter counts, pension rates) these models efficiently whenever new legislative budgets are passed. The sandbox shall include an approval process with time-stamped authorization, maintain multiple saved versions of each scenario, and synchronize finalized legislative updates with the SAFS production environment. | Support preparing and loading sandbox with four years of funds and rules | In response to each budget passed by the legislature, OSPI needs to be able to load the new rules and funds into the system for the coming four years. This is called the sandbox. | Data Reporting | Annual Financial Statement (F-196) | Epic | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005APP | The updated system should continue supporting electronic retention and provide secure storage with search and retrieval capabilities, ensuring records are audit-ready without paper. | ADA Compliance for Reports | OSPI staff previously printed expenditure pages for review and record retention. SME confirmed this is no longer required since documents are stored electronically. | Data Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005EXP | The system must include embedded documentation, training guides, and knowledge transfer materials. It should also store business rules (e.g., edits, approval conditions) in a transparent, staff-accessible format. This reduces onboarding pain, preserves institutional knowledge, and ensures continuity when staff transitions occur. | Lack of Documentation & Training | SME inherited the system with minimal knowledge transfer and had to reverse-engineer processes, creating inefficiency and risk. He highlighted that institutional knowledge was lost when prior staff left. | Data Reporting | Financial Expenditures Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005PRS | The future system must replace Access with a modern database or warehouse solution. Role-based security should allow multiple OSPI staff to run calculations, extract reports, and access data without bottlenecks. Centralizing the data in a supported environment will also enable integration with downstream systems and improve business continuity by reducing reliance on a single expert. | Dependence on Access Database for Staff Calculations | Staffing data is still processed and analyzed in Microsoft Access. SME described a workflow where district submissions are exported from EDS into Access, where queries and macros are run to prepare compliance and apportionment data. This approach restricts access to one SME and limits data availability to a small group. Access is also an aging technology with limited IT support, creating risk for long-term sustainability. | Data Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 005TRB | The system must have native ADA-compliant reporting capabilities, automatically generating outputs that meet accessibility standards. This will reduce remediation effort, improve turnaround time for publishing reports, and ensure equitable access to information. | Non-ADA Compliant Reports | Reports generated from the current system are not ADA-compliant. SME often spends days manually remediating reports to meet accessibility standards before publishing them. This adds unnecessary delays, limits transparency, and introduces risks of non-compliance with accessibility laws. | Data Reporting | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006INT | The system should support forecasting and trend analytics by retaining deep historical data and providing data models optimized for predictive reporting. Standardized schemas and consistent historical records will enable more robust analysis to support decision-makers. | Limited ability for forecasting and proactive analytics | Currently, SME can only report on what happened last year. Without structured, historical, and standardized data, forecasting trends such as levy collection or district financial health is difficult and time-intensive. This limits the ability to provide proactive insights for policy and decision-making. | Data Reporting | Data Integration Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 006TRB | The system should provide a unified data model and shared access framework to ensure that all teams use the same authoritative source. Standardized reporting and integration across systems will reduce duplication, eliminate inconsistencies, and increase trust in outputs. | Data Silos & Inconsistent Use of S-275 Data | Different OSPI teams pull S-275 and related data in different ways, often resulting in inconsistent outputs and interpretations. This lack of standardization undermines confidence in the data and forces additional reconciliation work across departments. | Data Reporting | Financial Policy Tribal Research | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007BUD | The system must replace Access-based reporting with a modern, secure, and scalable solution. A centralized data mart or SQL-based repository should store F-195 data, with self-service reporting capabilities provided through a user-friendly visualization tool such as Tableau. This would allow districts, unions, and OSPI to filter, query, and analyze data without technical barriers, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and long-term sustainability of reporting. | Reliance on Outdated Access Files for F-195 Reporting | F-195 budget reporting outputs are currently generated as Microsoft Access database files. SME noted that this is a legacy approach, prone to corruption, and requires manual intervention to create and distribute. Access is no longer a supported platform for enterprise reporting, and its limitations prevent flexible, modern analysis. School districts and unions depend on these files for extracting program-level and object-level data, but the process is cumbersome and risks inconsistencies year to year, especially when item codes or formulas change. \n\nA CSV file format would be better in the future. It would allow for the front end user to have access to all the data on back-end | Data Reporting | Budgeting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 007PRS | The system must include automated publishing options that generate simplified datasets and reports with predefined field subsets. Configurable export formats (CSV, Excel, PDF) should be supported, with automated scheduling. This ensures consistency and reduces staff effort while maintaining control over sensitive data. \n | Manual Production of Simplified Data Versions | SME confirmed that staff still manually create simplified versions of S-275 data in Access, Excel, and PDFs for public or stakeholder consumption. This requires reformatting and extraction of selected fields. The process is repetitive and error-prone, with little standardization across outputs. | Data Reporting | Personnel Reporting | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 011SAFS | Currently, districts are identified in SAFS using the CCDDD (County/District number), which does not distinguish special cases, requiring manual adjustments in Excel. The system shall provide the capability to identify and reclassify exceptions for specialized institutions such as Charter Schools, Tribal Schools, and Juvenile Detention Schools within the apportionment system. It shall automate the process of converting monthly payment and compensation increase data from revenue codes to appropriate AFRS budget codings, using appropriation codes matched to school identifiers. This automation shall replace the current manual Excel-based process and ensure accurate, fund-specific reporting for all school types. | Charter School and Compensation Increase calculation exceptions must be automated | Monthly payment data is converted from revenue codes displayed on reports to AFRS budget coding. And because Charter Schools are paid out of a different fund most of their payments need to be removed from each revenue code and combined into a different budget coding. This is also similar to the compensation increase budget coding. | Data Reporting | All | Task | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 014SAFS | The system must display calculated values on data entry or reporting screens but restrict users from editing them. These read-only fields should be visually distinct, such as by using a shaded background. This ensures users can view system-derived values for verification while maintaining data integrity. | Display of calculated fields | A field that contains a value derived from a system calculation is displayed on the appropriate data input or report page but cannot be edited by the user. Such fields are indicated by a physical differentiation, such as the presence of a grey background. | Data Reporting | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 015SAFS | When users save partially completed data, the system must still display calculated field values based on available information. Even if some components of the calculation are missing, the display should show interim results after clicking “Save” or “Save and Return.” | Displaying calculated fields when component data are not complete | Fields that include a value that is derived from a system calculation should, once the ‘Save’ or ‘Save and Return’ button has been clicked, show the calculated value, even if not all fields that contribute to that sum have been populated. | Data Reporting | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 018SAFS | The system must standardize date entry, display, and storage formats for accuracy and usability. Dates must be stored as MMDDYYYY and displayed with slashes (MM/DD/YYYY), regardless of input format variations such as MM.DD.YYYY. For month/year-only fields, the system must retain MMYYYY and display it accordingly. This uniformity improves data compatibility and user experience across all modules. | Entry, display, and retention of dates | Wherever a date that includes the day of the month is required (as opposed to a Month/Year), the date must be retained as MMDDYYYY. When displayed, slashes ("/") will be inserted between the Month and Day, and Day and Year.\nUsers may enter the month as MMDDYYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, MM,DD,YYYY or MM.DD.YYYY.\nWherever a date that does not include the day of the month is required, they must be retained as MMYYYY. This value will be displayed either as Month, Year (in one or two fields) or MM/YYYY, as described in the User Interface specification.\nDepending on the User Interface specification, Months may be selected from a dropdown menu or entered as MM. Years may be selected from a dropdown menu or entered as YYYY. | Data Reporting | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 020SAFS | If a user attempts to leave a page with unsaved changes, the system must prompt them to confirm their action. A clear warning message should inform users that unsaved data will be lost unless saved first. | Action triggered by navigating away from a page with unsaved data | If the user attempts to navigate away from a page without having saved any changes they've made in the current session, the system must display a message asking whether they want to continue the process and lose their data, or if they want to save their changes. | Data Reporting | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |

| 024SAFS | Each component within the Apportionment System (such as F195, Budget Extension Statement (F-200), and Enrollment Reporting (P-223)) must share a consistent user experience and visual design. The interface should maintain uniform navigation, data entry patterns, and reporting layouts. | Common UX across components | Each component of the Apportionment system must employ a common UX and cohesive, shared design language where possible to provide data-driven screen, reports, perform calculations and run edits. | Data Reporting | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| 025SAFS | The system must employ common calculation methods, rounding rules, and business logic across all modules where applicable. This consistency eliminates discrepancies between components like F195, Budget Extension Statement (F-200), and Enrollment Reporting (P-223). Shared calculation frameworks enhance reliability and simplify maintenance. Standardizing logic also reduces testing effort and improves data reconciliation across the Apportionment ecosystem. | Common calculation processes across components | Each component of the Apportionment system must employ common calculations, rounding, business logic, and edit functionality to the degree practical. | Data Reporting | All | Functional Req | NaN | NaN | NaN |

Open Doors and Running Start data is distributed to districts on paper forms, which the districts need to review and enter manually. | Data Reporting | Enrollment Reporting (P-223) | Enhancement Request | Enrollment Data | NaN | NaN |
| NaN | The system should be able to compile individual district reports into a single consolidated package automatically, without requiring Adobe Acrobat scripting or manual manipulation. This includes generating both district-level and statewide rollups in standardized formats, with the ability to schedule or batch reports as needed. By automating report compilation and distribution, staff time will be saved, errors minimized, and reports delivered faster to fiscal teams and the public website. | NaN | The apportionment system produces multiple individual reports for districts, but it lacks the ability to generate a consolidated package. SME must download the reports, then use Adobe Acrobat and JavaScript scripts to compile them into a single deliverable. This manual step is both technical and cumbersome, and SME admitted she does not fully understand the code in the script, making it fragile if errors arise. Automating report compilation within the system would significantly reduce reliance on Adobe scripting and minimize risk. The current format of the PDF reports does not meet ADA accessibility standards. | Data Reporting | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
| NaN | While reports have not been processed through ADA compliance tools in recent years, the system should still be capable of generating reports in an ADA-compliant format if required by state or federal guidelines. This may include automated tagging, accessible formatting, and compatibility with assistive technologies. Clarifying the requirement with OSPI leadership will determine whether ADA compliance remains mandatory, but the system should be designed with accessibility in mind to ensure long-term compliance flexibility. | NaN | The 2018 process indicated that all reports had to undergo ADA compliance remediation before posting. SME stated she has never performed ADA remediation and suspects that OSPI has an exception to bypass this requirement. This means the original pain point may no longer apply, but it remains an area requiring clarification. | Data Reporting | Apportionment | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
