Request for Proposals No. 2026-12
Addendum 01 – Pre-Bid Conference Q&A

This  document  is  posted  to  capture  the  questions  received,  and  agency  answers  provided,
during the Pre-Bid Conference, which was held on December 9, 2025.

All amendments, addenda, and notifications related to this procurement will be posted on the
OSPI  website  (if  this  was  an  open  procurement)  and  on  the  Washington  Electronic  Business
Solution (WEBS) website. Additional questions concerning this procurement must be submitted
to contracts@K12.wa.us. Communication directed to other parties will be considered unofficial
and non-binding on OSPI, and may result in disqualification of the Consultant.

1.  Question: Given the emphasis on projections and better use of data, is OSPI open to
AI/ML-based capabilities (for forecasting, anomaly detection, or scenario modeling), and
are  there  any  specific  governance  or  review  requirements  for  those  components?
Reference: RFP, p. 11 (SASQUATCH Key Objectives – Projections, Better Data/Decisions).
Answer:  Consider  OSPI  to  be  cautiously  interested.  One  can  imagine,  for  example,
providing an AI tool to find insights within or forecasting using reported data. But in the
data  collection,  calculation,  and  data  reporting  processes,  we  must  proceed  very
thoughtfully  to  ensure  accuracy,  traceability,  and  predictability,  and  to  conform  with
guidance provided by WaTech and the Washington State Legislature.

3.  Question:  Why  the  change  in  implementation  schedule  from  3  to  2  years  from  the

previous bid?
Answer:  With  a  contract  start  date  of  July  1,  2026,  OSPI  is  interested  in  having
development  completed,  and  portions  of  the  new  system  released  for  the  2027-28
school year and all other portions of the system available for use in the 2028-29 school
year.  During the 2028-29 school year through June 2029, OSPI does anticipate there will
be some corrections, enhancements, and other changes necessary, but these would be
similar to the changes, corrections and enhancements that may be required every year
based on legislative changes or agency needs.

4.  Question: For the additional collaboration costs and staffing we’re asked to describe if
other vendors are awarded remaining Work Sections, should those costs be included in
the  evaluated  total  cost,  or  treated  as  informational  and  excluded  from  the  scoring
calculations?  Reference:  RFP,  pp.  24  (multi-vendor  scenarios),  45  (collaboration  cost
section).
Answer:  Collaboration  costs  should  be  identified  in  the  appropriate  line  of  the
Attachment D: Cost Proposal Breakdown Workbook. Total project implementation costs
will  be  considered  when  evaluating  proposals  to  ensure  a  comprehensive  review  of
project details.  Collaboration costs are intended to provide clarity in additional costs to
be expected when multiple vendors must work together.  However, if a bidder is awarded

OSPI RFP No. 2026-12 | Addendum 01

more than one work section, additional collaboration would not be necessary for work
in the awarded sections, and the collaboration costs identified for those work sections
would not be awarded as part of the total contract.

5.  Question:  Do  you  have  any  quantifiable  outcomes  or  results?  Cycle  time,  personnel

costs, quality of reports?
Answer: If you are asking about the development cycle, the successful bidder will be
expected  to  adhere  to  accepted  Agile/Scrum  and  Project  Management  Professional
practices.
If, instead, you are asking about the project goals, these can be found at a high level on
Page 11 of the RFP. Specific measures for each will be developed in the discovery phase.

6.  Question: Do your legacy reports include pixel perfect reporting, including pagination,

etc. and if so, are you expecting pixel perfect/paginated reports in Sasquatch?
Answer: OSPI expects many of the reports that will be created from SASQUATCH to be
available for printing in a high quality, professional format. Examples include the budget
and financial reports that are required by state law and regulation in the format dictated
by the State Auditor’s Office and OSPI.  At the same time, OSPI expects that new ad-hoc
reporting functionality in SASQUATCH will eliminate the need for many of the reports
currently distributed in PDF format.

7.  Question: The information collected in these forms is at an aggregate level (e.g., student
count at a school and grade level). Do you not have access to student level data or are
there  any  restrictions  (law/processes)  that  prohibits  you  from  collecting  and  using
student level data for the calculations?
Answer: OSPI has access to student level data, but that data does not include all of the
elements required for purposes of funding calculations.  There are no statutory barriers
to  using  our  existing  student  level  data,  but  use  of  that  data  may  require  additional
changes  to  other  systems  and  have  unintended  consequences  to  district  users/  data
submitters.  OSPI is interested in exploring efficiencies in data collection as part of the
transition to SASQUATCH.

8.  Question: Can you elaborate on the "misalignment of future state objectives" from the

last RFP?
Answer: OSPI received many excellent proposals during the previous RFPs.  However,
the previous RFP was interpreted heavily toward Data Calculation, and many proposals
did not clearly articulate the requirements for data collection and reporting in a way that
produced comprehensive proposals.  We believe this impacted Bidder’s ability to provide
balanced proposals identifying solutions for all the business requirements of this project.

9.  Question:  From  your  perspective,  what  are  the  biggest  challenges  you  anticipate  in

training school districts, ESDs, and charter/tribal schools on SASQUATCH?
Answer: Entities served by SASQUATCH utilize a variety of Student Information Systems
(SIS) to track and manage program requirements. It’s worth noting that the majority of
districts have chosen to use a third-party tool provided by WSIPC for submitting their
data to us.
Training  opportunities  currently  in  place  (e.g.,  annual  user-manual  updates,  region  or
district  visits,  and  updates  via  email)  may  be  sufficient  for  relaying  the  bulk  of  the
information that will affect external users
Nevertheless,  we  welcome  suggestions  for  further  tools  and  approaches  for  sharing
information that minimizes the impact on each entity.

10. Question: Is OSPI open to the use of new tools, such as Microsoft Power BI, as part of
the proposed solution, and if so, how would you like bidders to address any additional
licensing  needs  in  our  proposals,  particularly  if  OSPI  does  not  currently  own  those
licenses?
Answer:  OSPI  is  open  to  all  proposed  solutions  that  meet  the  requirements  of  this
project, including the use of secondary tools.  However, any additional tools or licensing
required to implement a proposed solution must be identified in the proposal.  You may
assume that OSPI would need to purchase the new tools, licenses, including any training
to develop staff competency, and all such costs should be identified in your proposal.

11. Question: Could you clarify your expectations for the demo? Are you primarily looking
for a demo of our existing configurable platform Or do you expect more of a prototype
/  wireframe  /  walkthrough  of  the  future  SASQUATCH  workflows,  even  if  underlying
functionality is not yet implemented?
Answer:  OSPI  does  not  expect  you  to  develop  a  final  product for  the  demonstration
portion of this RDP.  Rather, please review the demonstration scenarios and consider the
best way to present this information to OSPI. Demonstrations will be evaluated based
on the information provided in Attachment C: Sasquatch Demonstration Scenarios.

12. Question: Organization Change Management (OCM) is requested on this project, but
no specific framework is mentioned (e.g. Prosci ADKAR, Kotter).  Are there specific OCM
artifacts  expected  to  maintain  adoption,  address  resistance,  and  ensure  consistent
readiness across all groups?
Answer: OSPI prefers you to provide OCM using the Prosci model. However, other OCM
models clearly articulated would be acceptable if they address the OCM needs of the
project.

13. Question: Are you Open for Customizable COTS solution?

Answer:  Yes,  OSPI  is  not  excluding  any  category  of  solution  at  this  time  and  would
consider a COTS solution if one was available to meet the business needs of the proposal.

14. Question:  You  mentioned  including  costs  for  licensing  for  tools  proposed  outside  of

what is in the RFP. Are we to include all licensing costs?
Answer: Yes.

15. Question: How many proposals did you receive from previous RFPs?

Answer:  We  received  one  responsive  proposal  from  the  first  RFP  attempt,  and  9
responsive from the second.

16. Question: Do you feel comfortable with your current business processes?

Answer: The processes are well known by our SMEs and generate the correct data, but
only with a large amount of manual work and specialized knowledge on the part of our
in-house staff.

17. Question: RE:  Attachment A: SASQUATCH System Requirements – Data Reporting Sheet
There are many cells in "Vendor Readiness Explanation" column of the Data Reporting
sheet that will not allow us to enter a response, such as ID 001 BUD. When we attempt
to enter a response, a popup message states: "The cell or chart you're trying to change
is on a protected sheet. To make a change, unprotect the sheet." The sheet is password
protected, preventing us from unprotecting the sheet. Please advise how we can respond
to all rows in the Data Reporting sheet.
Answer: This format and protection error in the file has been corrected, and an updated
copy of the file has been posted to WEBS and OSPI’s website. All cells in the “Vendor
Readiness  Explanation”  column  have  been  unlocked  to  allow  your  comments  to  be
entered and saved. Thank you for calling out the issue.

18. Question: RE:  Attachment A: SASQUATCH System Requirements – Data Reporting Sheet
The "Vendor Readiness" column in the Data Reporting sheet does not have the same
dropdown options (e.g. "out of the box," "configuration," et al) as the other sheets in
the requirements file. Further, we cannot manually enter a response. When we attempt
to respond, a popup message states: "The cell or chart you're trying to change is on a
protected sheet. To make a change, unprotect the sheet." The sheet is password
protected, preventing us from unprotecting the sheet. Please advise how we can
respond to the "Vendor Readiness" column on the Data Reporting sheet.
Answer:  This  validation  and  protection  error  in  the  file  has  been  corrected,  and  an
updated copy of the file has been posted to WEBS and OSPI’s website. All cells in the
“Vendor Readiness” column have been updated to allow you to select the appropriate
dropdown options.  Thank you for calling out the issue.

19. Question: RE:  Attachment A: SASQUATCH System Requirements – Data Collection Sheet
The "Requirement Description" cell for Requirement 137SAFS on the Data Collection
Sheet is empty. Does the State wish to add a requirement?
Answer: Thank you for the catch.  The requirement titled 137SAFS has been removed
from the project requirements. This row has been updated to indicate that no response
is required from prospective bidders.

No questions or responses included in this document require any changes to the solicitation
document; this document stands alone.
