**RE: RFP 2026-12 — School Apportionment System Modernization (SASQUATCH)**

Dear Dr. Reykdal and Selection Committee,

Resource Data, Inc. is honored to submit this proposal for the SASQUATCH initiative.

We've read your RFP carefully—not just the requirements, but between the lines. We recognize that your team has carried an increasingly heavy burden: a 20-year-old system that requires heroic manual effort every processing cycle, calculations that auditors question because they can't see the logic, and a legislature that changes funding formulas faster than your current tools can adapt. **Your staff deserves better.**

We understand that OSPI isn't just looking for a vendor to build software. You need a partner who will stand beside you through a complex modernization, transfer real knowledge to your team, and leave you stronger and more self-sufficient than when we arrived. That's exactly how we work.

Our approach is built on three principles:

- **Transparent Accountability** — Complete audit trails with drill-down visibility, reducing audit prep by <span class="mock">70%</span>
- **Proven K-12 Expertise** — 37 years delivering education technology; <span class="mock">$20.6B</span> in funding systems managed
- **Compliant Innovation** — Azure Government FedRAMP High with a rules engine enabling <span class="mock">93%</span> faster formula changes

These aren't just words. Our implementations for <span class="mock">Oregon DOE ($12.4B annual funding)</span> and <span class="mock">Idaho State Controller ($8.2B transactions)</span> delivered measurable results: <span class="mock">65% faster processing, 99% fewer integration failures</span>, and finance officers who now trust the numbers because they can see exactly how they're calculated.

With our Portland, OR office just hours from Olympia, we bring Pacific Northwest presence to complement our 200+ professionals nationwide. We are committed to delivering SASQUATCH on time, on budget, and leaving your team fully capable of extending the system as Washington's education funding needs evolve.

We look forward to demonstrating our capabilities and discussing how Resource Data can support OSPI's mission.

Respectfully submitted,

**[Signature]**

### 9.2 Critical Risks & Mitigations

#### 🔴 Legislative Formula Changes During Development
**Risk Level: CRITICAL** | Likelihood: High | Impact: High

Washington's education funding formulas change frequently with legislative sessions. Mid-project formula changes could invalidate completed work and extend timelines.

**Our Mitigation:**
- **Configurable Rules Engine**: Business users update formulas without code changes—<span class="mock">proven at Oregon DOE where we achieved 93% faster formula updates</span>
- **Sandbox Environment**: Test formula changes against prior-year data before production deployment
- **10% Timeline Buffer**: Dedicated change absorption capacity built into project schedule
- **Legislative Monitoring**: Proactive tracking of pending education legislation

---

#### 🟡 Integration Complexity with Legacy Systems
**Risk Level: ELEVATED** | Likelihood: High | Impact: Medium

SASQUATCH must integrate with 18+ existing OSPI systems (CEDARS, iGrants, EDS, etc.), many with undocumented APIs and legacy protocols.

**Our Mitigation:**
- **Early Proof-of-Concept**: Integration POCs in Phase 1 before committing to architecture
- **Universal Connector Framework**: Standardized adapters for REST, SOAP, SFTP, and legacy protocols—<span class="mock">successfully connected 17 systems at Idaho State Controller</span>
- **Incremental Integration**: Connect systems one-by-one with validation checkpoints
- **Fallback Options**: Manual data exchange capability preserved until integration proven

---

#### 🟡 Data Migration Quality Issues
**Risk Level: ELEVATED** | Likelihood: Medium | Impact: High

Migrating 20+ years of apportionment data from SAFS carries risk of data corruption, missing records, or calculation discrepancies.

**Our Mitigation:**
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Automated reconciliation comparing source and target totals
- **Parallel Operations**: Run SAFS and SASQUATCH simultaneously for one full cycle before cutover
- **Rollback Capability**: Full restore to SAFS possible within <span class="mock">4 hours</span> if critical issues discovered
- **Data Lineage Tracking**: Every migrated record traced to source with transformation audit trail

---

#### 🟡 ADA Compliance Gaps
**Risk Level: ELEVATED** | Likelihood: Medium | Impact: High

Public-facing systems must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Compliance gaps discovered late cause expensive rework.

**Our Mitigation:**
- **Accessibility-First Design**: WCAG compliance built into UI component library from day one
- **Automated Testing**: axe-core and WAVE integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- **Expert Audits**: Third-party accessibility review at each major milestone
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Manual testing with NVDA and VoiceOver throughout development

---

#### 🟡 Scope Creep from Requirement Ambiguity
**Risk Level: ELEVATED** | Likelihood: High | Impact: Medium

243 requirements contain varying levels of detail. Ambiguous requirements lead to scope disputes and timeline pressure.

**Our Mitigation:**
- **Change Control Board**: Formal process for evaluating scope changes with OSPI sign-off
- **Requirement Freeze**: Baseline requirements locked after Discovery phase (Week 10)
- **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Every deliverable has measurable, testable acceptance criteria
- **Bi-Weekly Demos**: Regular stakeholder visibility prevents late-stage surprises

---

### 9.3 Manageable Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|:-----|:-----------|:-------|:-----------|
| **Timeline constraints** | Medium | Medium | Agile sprints with MVP prioritization; parallel workstreams for independent modules |
| **UAT stakeholder availability** | Medium | Medium | Scheduled dedicated windows; trained proxy users; remote session capability |
| **Key personnel turnover** | Low | High | Cross-training across all roles; comprehensive documentation; 2-week knowledge transfer protocols |
| **Azure service disruptions** | Low | Medium | Multi-region deployment design; SLA-backed uptime guarantees; documented DR procedures |
| **District adoption resistance** | Medium | Low | OCM program with pilot districts; super-user network; phased rollout with feedback loops |

---

### 9.4 Contingency Allocation

| Risk Category | Contingency Hours | Budget | Covers |
|:--------------|------------------:|-------:|:-------|
| **Technical Risks** | 1,260 | <span class="mock">$180,000</span> | Legislative changes, integration complexity |
| **Data/Migration** | 300 | <span class="mock">$42,000</span> | Data quality issues, reconciliation failures |
| **People/Process** | 280 | <span class="mock">$40,000</span> | UAT availability, personnel turnover, adoption |
| **Compliance** | 150 | <span class="mock">$21,000</span> | ADA compliance gaps, security findings |
| **Management Reserve** | 320 | <span class="mock">$45,000</span> | Unforeseen issues |
| **Total Contingency** | **2,310** | <span class="mock">**$328,000**</span> | |

*Contingency included in <span class="mock">$9M</span> total budget.*

### 10.1 <span class="mock">Oregon Department of Education: Statewide Funding System Modernization</span>

| **Project Scope** | **Value Delivered** |
|:------------------|:--------------------|
| <span class="mock">$12.4B annual funding distribution</span> | <span class="mock">**65%** faster processing cycles</span> |
| <span class="mock">197 school districts served</span> | <span class="mock">**70%** reduction in audit prep time</span> |
| <span class="mock">22-month implementation</span> | <span class="mock">**<0.3%** calculation error rate</span> |
| <span class="mock">16 FTE delivery team</span> | <span class="mock">**4.6/5.0** user satisfaction score</span> |

**The Challenge:**
<span class="mock">Oregon's 15-year-old School Funding Allocation System (SFAS) could no longer keep pace with legislative complexity. Manual Excel-based calculations for 197 districts created a 3-week processing bottleneck each cycle. Auditors spent 18+ days annually reconciling formula outputs, and staff turnover meant critical institutional knowledge walked out the door.</span> *Sound familiar? These mirror OSPI's exact pain points with SAFS.*

**Our Solution:**
We deployed an **Azure Government**-hosted platform (FedRAMP High authorized) built on **ASP.NET Core 8** with a **configurable rules engine** that empowered business users to update funding formulas without developer intervention. Key innovations included:

- **Plain-English Formula Display**: Every calculation shows the underlying logic, eliminating "black box" concerns
- **Real-Time Audit Dashboard**: Drill-down from statewide totals to individual student records
- **Automated Data Pipelines**: Direct integration with Oregon's student information system via REST APIs, replacing manual CSV uploads
- **Sandbox Environment**: Staff test formula changes against prior-year data before production deployment

**Measurable Outcomes:**

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:------|:-------|
| Processing cycle time | <span class="mock">21 days</span> | <span class="mock">7 days</span> | <span class="mock">**65% reduction**</span> |
| Audit preparation | <span class="mock">18 days</span> | <span class="mock">5 days</span> | <span class="mock">**70% reduction**</span> |
| Calculation errors | <span class="mock">2.8%</span> | <span class="mock">0.27%</span> | <span class="mock">**90% improvement**</span> |
| Formula change turnaround | <span class="mock">6 weeks</span> | <span class="mock">3 days</span> | <span class="mock">**93% faster**</span> |

**Lessons Learned & OSPI Application:**
<span class="mock">Mid-project legislative changes tested our adaptability—we implemented agile 2-week sprints with a dedicated change buffer (10% of timeline), a practice we've built into our SASQUATCH proposal. The configurable rules engine we developed has since been enhanced and will directly accelerate OSPI's implementation.</span>

> <span class="mock">*"Resource Data transformed how we manage school funding. The transparency alone has changed our relationship with districts—they trust the numbers because they can see exactly how we calculated them. I'd recommend them without hesitation."*
> — **Sarah Chen, Chief Financial Officer, Oregon Department of Education**</span>

**How This Maps to OSPI:**

| OSPI Requirement | Our Proven Capability | Evidence |
|:-----------------|:---------------------|:---------|
| Configurable apportionment formulas | Rules engine for business users | <span class="mock">93% faster formula changes</span> |
| Transparent calculations | Plain-English formula display | <span class="mock">70% faster audit prep</span> |
| Audit trail requirements | Real-time audit dashboard | <span class="mock">Zero compliance findings</span> |

### 10.2 <span class="mock">Idaho State Controller: Enterprise Financial System Integration</span>

| **Project Scope** | **Value Delivered** |
|:------------------|:--------------------|
| <span class="mock">17 legacy systems consolidated</span> | <span class="mock">**100%** integration success rate</span> |
| <span class="mock">$8.2B annual transactions</span> | <span class="mock">**99.97%** data migration accuracy</span> |
| <span class="mock">18-month implementation</span> | <span class="mock">**Zero** production outages</span> |
| <span class="mock">12 FTE delivery team</span> | <span class="mock">**On-time, on-budget** delivery</span> |

**The Challenge:**
<span class="mock">Idaho's 25-year-old mainframe-based accounting system had become a compliance liability. Seventeen external systems—from payroll to grants management—required manual reconciliation. A single integration failure during fiscal year-end nearly caused a $40M reporting error. The state needed a modern platform that could handle complex integrations while maintaining continuous operations during migration.</span>

**Our Solution:**
We designed a **phased migration strategy** with parallel operations, ensuring zero disruption to Idaho's financial operations. Our **Integration Hub** architecture—built on **Azure Service Bus** with **REST/SOAP adapters**—provided:

- **Universal Connector Framework**: Standardized integration patterns for legacy COBOL systems, modern APIs, and SFTP file transfers
- **Automated Validation Engine**: Cross-system reconciliation with real-time discrepancy alerts
- **Rollback Capability**: Any integration could revert to legacy mode within 15 minutes
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Every transaction traced from source system through transformation to destination

**Measurable Outcomes:**

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|:------|:-------|
| Integration failures/month | <span class="mock">23</span> | <span class="mock">0.3</span> | <span class="mock">**99% reduction**</span> |
| Reconciliation time | <span class="mock">5 days</span> | <span class="mock">4 hours</span> | <span class="mock">**94% reduction**</span> |
| Year-end close | <span class="mock">45 days</span> | <span class="mock">12 days</span> | <span class="mock">**73% faster**</span> |
| Support tickets | <span class="mock">180/month</span> | <span class="mock">22/month</span> | <span class="mock">**88% reduction**</span> |

**Lessons Learned & OSPI Application:**
<span class="mock">The key to zero-downtime migration was our "strangler fig" pattern—gradually routing traffic from legacy to modern systems while maintaining fallback capability. We'll apply this exact approach to SASQUATCH's integration with CEDARS, iGrants, EDS, and OSPI's 15+ other systems.</span>

> <span class="mock">*"We asked for the impossible—replace a mainframe while keeping operations running. Resource Data delivered. Their integration expertise is unmatched, and their team became an extension of ours."*
> — **Marcus Webb, Deputy State Controller, Idaho State Controller's Office**</span>

**How This Maps to OSPI:**

| OSPI Requirement | Our Proven Capability | Evidence |
|:-----------------|:---------------------|:---------|
| 18+ system integrations | Universal connector framework | <span class="mock">17 systems, 100% success</span> |
| Zero-downtime migration | Strangler fig pattern | <span class="mock">Zero production outages</span> |
| Audit transparency | Comprehensive transaction tracing | <span class="mock">99.97% accuracy</span> |
